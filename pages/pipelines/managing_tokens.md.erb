# Managing API Access Tokens

- org admins can view all tokens created on their organization
- use this for auditing user tokens and what access they have, and revoke access if required

<%= toc %>

## auditing tokens

- requires org admin
- the api access audit page can be found in the organization settings sidebar

- list of all users' tokens, the scope of their token, how long ago they were created, and how long since they've been used
- click through each token to see further information, or filter the list by any of the available fields

## revoking tokens

- on the API access audit page find the token you want to revoke
- search via user, token, IP, admin,

gif?

- click through the token you'd like to revoke, then click the Revoke Access button

- revoking a token will send a notification email to the user who owned the token 

## programatically managing tokens

- there is a REST API endpoint for managing API access tokens, can get or revoke tokens
- see the [REST API Access Token](/docs/apis/rest-api/access-token) page for further information

## faqs

### can I recover a revoked token?

- yes, a token isn't deleted when it's revoked - revoking removes the token's access to the organization data
- the token owner can re-add access to the organization 

### what happens if I revoke a token that's currently in use?

- all future requests will no longer successfully authorize
