# Managing API Access Tokens

On the API Access Audit page, organization admins can view all tokens that have been created with access to their organization data. As well as auditing user tokens and what access they have, you can also revoke a token's access to your organization data if required.

## FAQs

### Can I recover a revoked token?

Yes, a token isn't deleted when it's revoked using the API Access Audit in Buildkite. The 'Revoke Access' button will only remove the token's access to your organization's data. 

The token owner can re-add the organization to the token from their API Access Tokens settings page.   

### Can I delete a token?

Yes. If you need to delete a token entirely, you can use the REST API `revoke` endpoint.

### What happens if I revoke a token that's currently in use?

The token will lose access to the organization data. Any future API requests will no longer successfully authorize.
