# Managing Step Dependencies

- buildkite creates dependencies, there's shortcuts like wait and block
- but can explicitly declare dependencies with depends_on


- can do empty deps to declare that something has no deps (~ or empty array)
`blah.sh` won't wait for `test.sh`, but `waiter.sh` will

```
steps:
  - command: "test.sh"
  - wait
  - command: "blah.sh"
    depends_on: ~
  - command: "waiter.sh"
```

- waits have implicit deps on everything before it, everything after the waits have implicit deps on the wait

```
steps:
  # runs right away
  - command: "test1.sh"

  # runs right away
  - key: t2
    command: "test2.sh"

  - wait

  # runs right away since it has no deps
  - command: "blah.sh"
    depends_on: ~

  # waits for test1 and test2
  - command: "waiter.sh"

  # waits on test2 only
  - command: "partial-waiter.sh"
    depends_on: t2
```

- new type of step: input
steps:
  - input: "ask for input"

- input steps are the same as block steps, but they don't block, can have explicit deps with depends_on
