# Ignoring a Commit

Some code changes, such as editing a Readme, may not require a Buildkite build. If you want Buildkite to ignore a commit, add `[ci skip]` or `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message.

For example, the following commit message will cause Buildkite to ignore the commit and not create a corresponding build:

```
Fix readme typos [skip ci]
```

Multi-line commit messages are also supported. For example, the following commit message will also cause Buildkite to ignore the commit:

```
Fix readme typos

* Fixed the build badge
* Fixed broken GitHub link

[skip ci]
```

<h1>Skipping Commits with Bitbucket Server</h1>
<p>Not all webhooks from Bitbucket Server contain the commit's message. When a commit message is not included in a webhook, the build will run.</p>
