# Skipping builds

Build skipping allows you to avoid unnecessary rebuilds, conserving resources and freeing up agents.

## Skip queued intermediate builds

Sometimes you may push several commits in quick succession, leading to Buildkite building each commit in turn. You can choose to skip these intermediate builds, and only build the latest commit.

To skip pending builds on the same branch:

1. Navigate to your *Pipeline Settings*.
2. Select *Builds*.
3. Select *Skip Intermediate Builds*.
4. **Optional**: limit which branches build skipping applies to by adding branch names in the text box below *Skip Intermediate Builds*. For example, "branch-one" means Buildkite only skips intermediate builds on branch-one. You can also use not-equals: "!main" skips intermediate builds on all branches except main.

You can also configure these options using the [REST API](docs/apis/rest-api/pipelines#create-a-yaml-pipeline).

## Cancel running intermediate builds

Sometimes you may push several commits in quick succession, leading to Buildkite building each commit in turn. You can choose to cancel any running builds, and only build the latest commit.

To cancel running builds on the same branch:

1. Navigate to your *Pipeline Settings*.
2. Select *Builds*.
3. Select *Cancel Intermediate Builds*.
4. **Optional**: limit which branches build skipping applies to by adding branch names in the text box below *Cancel Intermediate Builds*. For example, "branch-one" means Buildkite only skips intermediate builds on branch-one. You can also use not-equals: "!main" skips intermediate builds on all branches except main.

You can also configure these options using the [REST API](docs/apis/rest-api/pipelines#create-a-yaml-pipeline).

## Ignore commits and branches

For information on skipping individual commits, refer to [Ignore commits](/docs/pipelines/ignoring_a_commit).

You can choose to always ignore certain branches. Refer to [Branch configuration](/docs/pipelines/branch-configuration) for more information.

## Skip builds using conditionals

You can use conditionals to skip builds at both the pipeline and step level. Refer to [Conditionals](/docs/pipelines/conditionals) for more information.
