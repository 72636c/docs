Buildkite Enterprise license covers every user of your code repository provider organization (for example, GitHub organization) or anyone who directly or indirectly interacts with your Buildkite organization. This includes users who log in to your Buildkite organization and external users who trigger builds via merging pull requests. Suppose a Buildkite Enterprise organization exceeds 100 users. In that case, new members can still be invited (or — if SSO is enabled — new members will still be auto-created upon signing in) for extra monthly charges.
