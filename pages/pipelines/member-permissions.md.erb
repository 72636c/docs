# Controlling member permissions

Enterprise customers can control user permissions for selected pipeline actions. 

<%= toc %>

User-level permissions are managed by organization admins, and can be found in the Organization Settings under Member Permissions.  

Organization admins can toggle whether or not users can:

- create pipelines
- make a private pipeline public
- create, edit, and delete notification services
- create, edit, and delete agent registration tokens
- disconnect agents

If your organization has teams enabled, the pipeline creation permissions are managed at a team level. Permissions controls can be found on the Teams Settings page.
