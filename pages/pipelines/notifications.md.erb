# Triggering Notifications

The `notify` attribute allows you to trigger build notifications to different services. You can also choose to conditionally send notifications based on pipeline events like build state.

{:toc}

Add notifications to your pipeline with the `notify` attribute. This sits at the same level as `steps` in your pipeline YAML.

For example, to send a notification email every time a build is created:

```yaml
steps:
  - command: "tests.sh"

notify:
  - email: "dev@acmeinc.com"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

Available notification types:

* [Email](#email): Send an email to the specified email address.
* [Basecamp](#basecamp-campfire-message): Post a message to a Basecamp Campfire. Requires a Basecamp Chatbot to be configured in your Basecamp organization.
* [Slack](#slack-channel-and-direct-messages): Post a message to the specified Slack Channel. Requires a Slack notification service to be enabled for each channel.
* [Webhooks](#webhooks): Send a notification to the specified webhook URL.
* [PagerDuty](#pagerduty-change-events)

## Conditional notifications

To only trigger notifications under certain conditions, add the `if` attribute.

For example, the following email notification will only be triggered if the build passes:

```yaml
notify:
  - email: "dev@acmeinc.com"
    if: build.state == "passed"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

See [Build States](#build-states) for possible values for the build state.

<section class="Docs__troubleshooting-note">
  <p>To trigger conditional notifications to a Slack channel, you will first need to configure <a href="/docs/integrations/slack#conditional-notifications">Conditional notifications for Slack</a>.
</section>

## Email

Add an email notification to your pipeline using the `email` attribute of the `notify` yaml block:

```yaml
notify:
  - email: "dev@acmeinc.com"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

The `email` attribute accepts a single email address as a string. To send notifications to more than one address, add each address as a separate email notification attribute:

```yaml
notify:
  - email: "dev@acmeinc.com"
  - email: "sre@acmeinc.com"
  - email: "qa@acmeinc.com"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

Email notifications happen at the following [event](/docs/apis/webhooks#events):

* `build finished`

## Basecamp Campfire message

To send notifications to a Basecamp Campfire, you'll need to set up a chatbot in Basecamp as well as adding the notification to your `pipeline.yml` file. Basecamp admin permission is required to setup your chatbot.

<section class="Docs__troubleshooting-note">
  <p>Campfire messages can only be sent using Basecamp 3.</p>
</section>

1. Add a [chatbot](https://m.signalvnoise.com/new-in-basecamp-3-chatbots/) to the Basecamp project or team that you'll be sending notifications to.
1. Set up your chatbot with a name and an optional URL. If you'd like to include an image, you can find the Buildkite logo in our [Brand Assets](https://buildkite.com/brand-assets).
1. On the next page of the chatbot setup, copy the URL that Basecamp provides in the `curl` code snippet
1. Add a Basecamp notification to your pipeline using the `basecamp_campfire` attribute of the `notify` yaml block and the URL copied from your Basecamp chatbot:

```yaml
notify:
  - basecamp_campfire: "https://3.basecamp.com/1234567/integrations/qwertyuiop/buckets/1234567/chats/1234567/lines"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

The `basecamp_campfire` attribute accepts a single URL as a string.

Basecamp notifications happen at the following [events](/docs/apis/webhooks#events), unless you restrict them using [conditionals](/docs/pipelines/notifications#conditional-notifications):

* `build created`
* `build started`
* `build blocked`
* `build finished`
* `build skipped`

## Slack channel and direct messages

You can set notifications:

* On build status events in the Buildkite UI by using your Slack Notification Service's 'Build State Filtering' settings.
* On step status and other non-build events by extending the Slack Notification Service using the `notify` attribute to your `pipeline.yml`.

Before adding a `notify` attribute to your `pipeline.yml`, ensure an organization admin has set up a [Slack integration](/docs/integrations/slack) for the channel or user that you want to post to. Buildkite Enterprise users can also check the ['Manage Notificats Services'](https://buildkite.com/organizations/~/member-permissions) checkbox to create, edit, or delete notification services. For detailed information about setting up a Notification Service, see the [Slack integration page](/docs/integrations/slack).

Once a Slack channel has been configured in your organization, add a Slack notification to your pipeline using the `slack` attribute of the `notify` yaml block.

<section class="Docs__troubleshooting-note">
  <p>When using just a channel name, you must specify it in quotes, as otherwise the <code>#</code> will cause the channel name to be treated as a comment.</p>
</section>

For example, to deliver build-level notifications to the `#general` channel of all configured workspaces:

```
notify:
  - slack: "#general"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

For step-level notifications to the `#general` channel of all configured workspaces, use the following syntax:

```
steps:
  label: "Example Test - pass"
    command: echo "Hello!"
    notify:
      - slack: "#general"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

For example, to deliver build-level notifications to user `@someuser` in all configured workspaces:

```
notify:
  - slack: "@someuser"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

For step-level notifications to to user `@someuser` in all configured workspaces:

```
steps:
  label: "Example Test - pass"
    command: echo "Hello!"
    notify:
      - slack: "@someuser"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}


To send a notification to one particular workspace and channel or workspace and user, specify the workspace name, too:

Build-level notifications for channels

```yaml
notify:
  # Notify channel
  - slack: "buildkite-community#general"
  # Notify user
  - slack: "buildkite-community@someuser"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

Step-level notifications for channels

```yaml
steps:
  label: "Example Test - pass"
    command: echo "Hello!"
    notify:
      # Notify channel
      - slack: "buildkite-community#general"
      # Notify user
      - slack: "buildkite-community@someuser"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

You can also specify multiple teams and channels with the `channels` attribute:

Build-level notifications

```yaml
notify:
  - slack:
      channels:
        - "buildkite-community#sre"
        - "buildkite-community#announcements"
        - "buildkite-team#monitoring"
        - "#general"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

Step-level notifications

```yaml
steps:
  label: "Example Test - pass"
    command: echo "Hello!"
    notify:
      - slack:
        channels:
          - "buildkite-community#sre"
          - "buildkite-community#announcements"
          - "buildkite-team#monitoring"
          - "#general"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

To add a custom message to the notification:

Build-level notifications

```yaml
notify:
  - slack:
      channels:
        - "buildkite-community#sre"
      message: "SRE related information here..."
  - slack:
      channels:
        - "buildkite-community#announcements"
      message: "General announcement for the team here..."
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

Step-level notifications

```yaml
steps:
  label: "Example Test - pass"
    command: echo "Hello!"
    notify:
      - slack:
        channels:
          - "buildkite-community#sre"
        message: "SRE related information here..."
          - "buildkite-community#announcements"
        message: "General announcement for the team here..."
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

You can also add [conditionals](/docs/pipelines/notifications#conditional-notifications) to restrict the events on which notifications are sent:

```yaml
notify:
  - slack: "#general"
    if: build.state == "passed"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

See [Build States](#build-states) for possible values for the build state.

Slack notifications happen at the following [event](/docs/apis/webhooks#events):

* `build finished`

<!---
* step-level events that trigger notifications need to go here
-->

## Webhooks

Send a notification to a webhook URL from your pipeline using the `webhook` attribute of the `notify` yaml block:

```yaml
notify:
  - webhook: "https://webhook.site/32raf257-168b-5aca-9067-3b410g78c23a"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

The `webhook` attribute accepts a single webhook URL as a string. To send notifications to more than one endpoint, add each URL as a separate webhook attribute:

```yaml
notify:
  - webhook: "https://webhook.site/82n740x6-168b-5aca-9067-3b410g78c23a"
  - webhook: "https://webhook.site/32raf257-81b6-9067-5aca-78s09m6102b4"
  - webhook: "https://webhook.site/27f518bw-9067-5aca-b681-102c847j917z"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

Webhook notifications happen at the following [events](/docs/apis/webhooks#events), unless you restrict them using [conditionals](/docs/pipelines/notifications#conditional-notifications):

* `build created`
* `build started`
* `build blocked`
* `build finished`

## PagerDuty Change Events

If you've set up a [PagerDuty integration](/docs/integrations/pagerduty) you can send Change Events from your pipeline using the `pagerduty_change_event` attribute of the `notify` yaml block:

```yaml
steps:
  - command: "tests.sh"

notify:
  - pagerduty_change_event: "636d22Yourc0418Key3b49eee3e8"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

Email notifications happen at the following [event](/docs/apis/webhooks#events):

* `build finished`

Restrict notifications to passed builds by adding a [conditional](#conditional-notifications):

```yaml
steps:
  - command: "tests.sh"

notify:
  - pagerduty_change_event: "636d22Yourc0418Key3b49eee3e8"
    if: "build.state == 'passed'"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}
