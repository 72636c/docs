# Triggering Notifications

- you can trigger build notifications to several different services
- can filter by pipeline events like build status

<%= toc %>

- add notifications to your pipeline with the `notify` attribute
- at the same level as `steps` in your pipeline yaml

```yaml
steps:
  - command: "tests.sh"
  - wait
  - command: "build.sh"

notify:
  - email: "dev@acmeinc.com"
```

- can trigger notifications as emails or basecamp campfire messages

## Conditional notifications

- You can choose to only trigger notifications when x evaluates to true using the `if` attribute
- in the below example the email notification will only be triggered if the build passes:

```yaml
notify:
  - email: "dev@acmeinc.com"
    if: "build.status == passed"
```

## Email

- add an email notification to your pipeline using the `email` attribute of the `notify` yaml block

```yaml
notify:
  - email: "dev@acmeinc.com"
```

- the `email` attribute accepts a single email address as a string

## Basecamp Campfire Message

- add a basecamp notification to your pipeline using the `basecamp_campfire` attribute of the `notify` yaml block

```yaml
notify:
  - basecamp_campfire: URL
```

- the `basecamp_campfire` attribute accepts a single URL as a string 
- the URL for your Basecamp Campfire can be created using the 'Generate a public link' button in Basecamp
