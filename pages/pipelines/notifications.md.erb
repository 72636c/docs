# Triggering Notifications

The `notify` attribute allows you to trigger build notifications to different services. You can also choose to conditionally send notifications based on pipeline events like build status.

<%= toc %>

Add notifications to your pipeline with the `notify` attribute. This sits  at the same level as `steps` in your `pipeline.yml` file.

The below example will send a notification email every time a build is created on this pipeline: 

```yaml
steps:
  - command: "tests.sh"
  - wait
  - command: "build.sh"

notify:
  - email: "dev@acmeinc.com"
```

You can trigger notifications as emails or as a message in a Basecamp Campfire.

## Conditional notifications

You can choose to only trigger notifications when a statement evaluates to true using the `if` attribute.

In the below example the email notification will only be triggered if the build passes:

```yaml
notify:
  - email: "dev@acmeinc.com"
    if: "build.status == passed"
```

## Email

Add an email notification to your pipeline using the `email` attribute of the `notify` yaml block:

```yaml
notify:
  - email: "dev@acmeinc.com"
```

The `email` attribute accepts a single email address as a string. To send notifications to more than one address, add each address as a separate email notification attribute:

```yaml
notify:
  - email: "dev@acmeinc.com"
  - email: "sre@acmeinc.com"
  - email: "qa@acmeinc.com"
```

## Basecamp Campfire Message

To send notifications to a Basecamp Campfire, you'll need to set up a chatbot in Basecamp as well as adding the notification to your `pipeline.yml` file. Basecamp admin permission will be required to setup your chatbot.

1. Add a [chatbot](https://m.signalvnoise.com/new-in-basecamp-3-chatbots/) to the Basecamp project or team that you'll be sending notifications to. 
1. Set up your chatbot with a name and an optional URL. If you'd like to include an image, you can find the Buildkite logo in our [Brand Assets](https://buildkite.com/brand-assets).
1. On the next page of the chatbot setup, copy the URL that Basecamp provides in the `curl` code snippet
1. Add a Basecamp notification to your pipeline using the `basecamp_campfire` attribute of the `notify` yaml block and the URL copied from your Basecamp chatbot:

```yaml
notify:
  - basecamp_campfire: URL
```

The `basecamp_campfire` attribute accepts a single URL as a string.
