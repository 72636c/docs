# Build limits

Each [Buildkite plan](https://buildkite.com/pricing) comes with a set amount of total [job minutes](#total-job-minutes) which depends on your plan and the size of your team.

## Job minutes

Job minutes are calculated as the total number of minutes run by all command step jobs in a build. It is calculated per-second, starting from when the agent starts running the command step, until the step has completed.

So a build that has ten command steps, each lasting a minute uses ten job minutes, and a build with one step that lasts twenty minutes, uses twenty job minutes. Whether jobs run sequentially or in parallel has no effect on the total.

When job limit allocation is reached on a free plan, builds are paused until the next month. Builds remain active, but jobs are not assigned to agents, until the next billing period.

## Build timeouts

Free plans have a [command step maximum timeout](/docs/pipelines/command-step#timeout_in_minutes) of 240 minutes.
