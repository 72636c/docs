# Block Step

A *block* step is used to pause the execution of a build and wait on a team member to unblock it (via the web or the API). With the addition of a custom prompt, you can also use it to collect data from your team for use later in the pipeline.

<%= toc %>

## block attributes

Attributes that are available to describe block steps in your `pipeline.yml`:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute</th>
    <th>Example</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>branches</td>
    <td>master</td>
    <td>
      The names of the branch or branches that will include this block step, separated by spaces.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>prompt</td>
    <td>To continue with your deploy, unblock this step by clicking continue</td>
    <td>The heading of the prompt that is opened when you click in a pipeline to unblock a step.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>fields</td>
    <td>text</td>
    <td>The type of field that will be added to the prompt form.<br>Available values: text, select.<br>All form fields are required by default.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


## fields attribute properties

Properties available to describe the `field` attribute inside a block step in your `pipeline.yml`:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute</th>
    <th>Example</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>key</td>
    <td>notify-team</td>
    <td>The slug to identify the field for later access via the buildkite-agent meta-data command.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>hint</td>
    <td>Please only select one team to notify</td>
    <td>The text displayed directly under the field label.</td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>options</td>
    <td>- Support<br>
    - Engineering<br>
    - Ops</td>
    <td>Only applicable to `select` fields, these populate the key/value pairs for radio buttons (6 or less values) or a dropdown list (more than 6 values).</td>
  </tr>
</table>


## Examples

Adding the `fields` attribute to a *block* step allows you to add custom fields to the prompt when you click on a *block* step:

```yml
- block: "Release \:bookmark_tabs\:"
  prompt: "Fill out the details for this release"
  fields: 
    - text: "Release notes"
      key: "release-notes"
      hint: "Enter your release notes here \:sparkles\:"
    - text: "Release name"
      key: "release-name"
      required: false
    - select: "Release type"
      key: "release-type"
      default: "Major"
      options:
        - Major
        - Minor
        - Patch
    - select: "Team to notify after release"
      key: "notify-team"
      options: 
        - Ops
        - Support
        - Engineering
        - QA
        - Sales
        - Directors
        - Everyone
```

The above code will generate a prompt that looks like this:

You can test out a live example by adding our sample pipeline with an unblock prompt step to your existing Buildkite organisation:
