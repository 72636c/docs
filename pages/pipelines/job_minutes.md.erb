# Job Minutes

Each [Buildkite plan](https://buildkite.com/pricing) comes with a set amount of total job minutes which depends on your plan and the size of your team.

Job minutes are calculated as the total number of minutes run by all command step jobs in a build. It is calculated per-second, starting from when the agent starts running the command step, until the step has completed.

You can find how many minutes a build took on the bottom of the [build page](/docs/pipelines#pipelines-page-walkthrough-build-page), and your organization [total build minutes](#usage-page) in Settings.

So a build that has ten command steps, each lasting a minute uses ten job minutes, and a build with one step that lasts twenty minutes, uses twenty job minutes. Whether jobs run sequentially or in parallel has no effect on the total.

## Usage page

The [Usage page](https://buildkite.com/organizations/~/settings/usage) shows your plan information, total job minutes, and job minutes used this month, as well as previous months.

## Limits for free plans

When the total job minutes limit is reached on a free plan, builds are paused until the next month. Builds remain active, but jobs are not assigned to agents until the next month.

### Build timeouts

Free plans have a [command step maximum timeout](/docs/pipelines/command-step#timeout_in_minutes) of 240 minutes.
