# Overview
	
## what are plugins

Plugins provide a way to extend the functionality that Buildkite natively offers. They act as a external repository of [Hooks][hooks] that are referenced from your `pipeline.yml` file, downloaded and run as part of your builds.

Plugins can be hosted on GitHub, BitBucket or a private git repository, and are automatically fetched as required. See [Plugin sources] for how you can host your own.

Buildkite offers a [collection of useful plugins][Buildkite Plugins] to get you started, including a [Docker Compose plugin], [Junit Annotate plugin], and the [Library Example plugin].

Agent plugins are still new, and we are evolving them as we learn more. We'd love feedback on how you use them and how we might make them better.
