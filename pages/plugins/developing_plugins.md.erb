# Developing plugins

The best place to get started is the [Buildkite Plugins] repository. You can also find third-party plugins with the [buildkite-plugin tag on GitHub][third party plugins].

## Writing a plugin step by step

Plugins are essentially a collection of hooks with extra configuration. The agent passes the plugin configuration from the pipeline.yml to the plugin hooks as environment variables.

A good example is the [docker plugin], which runs a command within a docker container. The pipeline invocation of this plugin looks like:

```yml
steps:
  - command: yarn install && yarn run test
    plugins:
      - docker#v1.0.0:
          image: node
          workdir: /app
```

In its root directory the plugin has a `plugin.yml` that describes what it does, the executables required on the agent machine, and a schema of the plugin’s configuration options:

```yml
name: Docker
description: Runs build steps within a docker container.
author: https://github.com/buildkite
requirements:
  - docker
configuration:
  properties:
    image:
      type: string
    workdir:
      type: string
  required:
    - image
    - workdir
```

The plugin’s hook scripts are placed in the `hooks/` directory. Here’s the simplified logic of the [command hook][hooks], which would exist at `hooks/command`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

echo "--- Running ${BUILDKITE_COMMAND} in ${BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_DOCKER_IMAGE}"

docker run -it --rm \
  --volume "${PWD}:${BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_DOCKER_WORKDIR}" \
  --workdir "${BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_DOCKER_WORKDIR}" \
  "${BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_DOCKER_IMAGE}" bash -c "${BUILDKITE_COMMAND}"
```

The environment variables are named `BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_{NAME}_{KEY}`, or if a list is provided then `BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_{NAME}_{KEY}_{IDX}`.

For example `image: "node"` becomes the environment variable `BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_DOCKER_IMAGE="node"`, and `links: [ "db", "redis" ]` becomes the enviroment variables `BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_DOCKER_LINKS_0="db"` and `BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_DOCKER_LINKS_1="redis"`.

## Testing your new plugin (how to use the tester and cli)

## Tools

The following are some helpful tools when developing plugins:

* [Plugin Tester] - A Docker image containing tools that simplifies writing BATS tests, and getting your plugin tested (so meta).
* [Plugin Linter] - A linter that checks your plugin for best practices.
* [Shellcheck Plugin] - A plugin for running Shellcheck on your hook scripts.
* [JSON Schema Lint] - A tool that allows for validating your JSON schema with YAML.
* [JSON Schema] - The JSON Schema spec.
* [Understanding JSON Schema] - A tutorial to help understand how to write JSON Schema.
* [Buildkite CLI] - A command line tool that can run Buildkite pipeline steps entirely locally.
