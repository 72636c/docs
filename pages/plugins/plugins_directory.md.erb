# Buildkite Plugins Directory

The [Plugins Directory](/plugins) is a listing of plugins created by both Buildkite and 3rd party contributors. Browse through the directory to search for new plugins to use, and to see how other teams are using plugins to solve common problems and speed up workflows.

Plugins created by the Buildkite team display the Buildkite logo in the directory. They can also be found in the official [Buildkite Plugins](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins) GitHub repository. Not every plugin is listed in the directory, only those tagged as a Buildkite plugin on GitHub.

## Add your plugin

1. Host your plugin on GitHub
1. Add the GitHub repository topic `buildkite-plugin`
1. Ensure your repository contains a valid `plugin.yml` file containing at least the `name` and `description` fields
