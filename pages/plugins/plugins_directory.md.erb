# Buildkite Plugins Directory

- a listing of plugins created by both buildkite and 3rd party contributors
- can be found here: [buildkite.com/plugins](https://buildkite.com/plugins)
- not all plugins are listed there, only those that meet our criteria
- it's a showcase of things you can do with Buildkite, you can see how other teams are going about common (or not so common) workflows

- buildkite created plugins have the buildkite logo on them in the directory, they can also be found in the official buildkite-plugins github repo

## how to get your plugin there

- host your plugin on github
- make sure your plugin meets our criteria


- add the github repo topic `buildkite-plugin` (screenshot)
- needs a valid plugin.yml file (containing a name and a description)
