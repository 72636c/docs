# Securing plugins

## using 3rd party code

Plugins introduce a third-party dependency in your pipeline. They provide a way to introduce executable code into your pipeline beyond scripts in your repository and access to the `pipeline.yml`.

## recommended practices

Recommended security practices:

 * Always pin to a particular version of the plugin, e.g. `docker-compose#287293c4`. You can refer to any git ref. The agent will check this out the first time it encounters it and then re-use that checked out code.
 * Follow the [Unofficial Bash Strict Mode] and check your work with [shellcheck].
 * Apply special care to avoid executing arbitrary code passed in to plugins by config. As these are just environment variables, anything that can set environment variables can mess with plugin configuration.

For particularly high-security setups, you can disable plugins selectively by removing them from the `BUILDKITE_PLUGINS` variable in your `environment` hook, or run agents with the `--no-plugins` flag.
