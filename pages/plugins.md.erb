# Overview
	
## What are plugins

Plugins provide a way to extend the functionality that Buildkite natively offers. They act as a external repository of [Hooks](/docs/agent/v3/hooks) that are referenced from your `pipeline.yml` file, and are downloaded and run as part of your build.

Plugins can be hosted on GitHub, BitBucket or a private git repository, and are automatically fetched as required. See the [Sources](/docs/plugins/using-plugins) section of the Using Plugins guide for how you can host your own.

Buildkite offers a collection of useful plugins to get you started, including a [Docker Compose plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/docker-compose-buildkite-plugin), [Junit Annotate plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/junit-annotate-buildkite-plugin), and the [Library Example plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/library-example-buildkite-plugin). In the [Buildkite Plugin Directory](https://buildkite.com/plugins) you can find all the offical plugins as well as the top plugins from third party developers. 

Agent plugins are still new, and we are evolving them as we learn more. We'd love feedback on how you use them and how we might make them better - let us know what you think in our [Community Forum](https://forum.buildkite.community/).

## how do they work

- at the most basic, plugins are code in files (example code), stored in hooks files so that the agent can access it at the appropriate time
- when you add a plugin to a buildkite pipeline step, that code is read by the agent
- some plugins allow configuration, any config that you've added in your pipeline.yml file is also read by the agent

- two main types of plugins:
- a repo of commands: stuff from the files can be referenced in your command scripts, like doing an import at the top of your code
- stuff you want to run before/after you run your script (can define any of the available hooks like pre-command, command, post-command etc.)

## common use cases

- prebuilding a docker image, then using the image in subsequent steps
- running steps in containers
- assume a role before running your script
- logging in to a service
