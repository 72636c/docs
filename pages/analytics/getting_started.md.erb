## What is a test suite


## What is a monitor

Configure monitors to track only the things you care about. Track [reliability](#reliability-monitor) over a specific number of days, or a specific number of test suite runs, and get alerts when a specific branch or or all branches get below your defined threshhold.

## Reliability monitor

_Reliability_ is defined as the percentage of passed test _runs_. It can be measured for individual tests, or for the whole test suite.

## Runtime monitor

_Runtime_ is definied as the total duration of the tests from start to finish.
