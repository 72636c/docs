## What is a test suite


## What is a monitor

Configure monitors to track only the things you care about. Track [reliability](#reliability-monitor) over a specific number of days, or a specific number of test suite runs, and get alerts when a specific branch or or all branches get below your defined threshold.

## Reliability monitor

_Reliability_ is defined as the percentage of passed test _runs_. It can be measured for individual tests, or for the whole test suite.

## Runtime monitor

_Runtime_ is defined as the total duration of the tests from start to finish.

## Alerts

When you get an alert from one of your monitors, see

- when it was last seen
- when it was first seen
- how many times it has happened

Mark it as resolved or, mute it, or leave it open.
