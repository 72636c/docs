# CI Environments

Buildkite Test Analytics collectors automatically detect common continuous integration (CI) environments.
If available, test collectors gather information about your test runs, such as branch names and build IDs.
Test collectors gather information from the following CI environments:

- Buildkite
- CircleCI
- GitHub Actions

If you use a test collector in any other environment, then you must set variables to report your CI details to Buildkite.

If you're not using a test collector, see [Importing JSON](/docs/test-analytics/importing-json) and [Importing JUnit XML](/docs/test-analytics/importing-junit-xml) to learn how to provide run environment data.

## Buildkite

During Buildkite pipeline runs, test collectors upload information from the following environment variables:

| Environment variable     | Description                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `BUILDKITE_BRANCH`       | the branch or reference for this build        |
| `BUILDKITE_BUILD_ID`     | the UUID for the build                        |
| `BUILDKITE_BUILD_NUMBER` | the build number                              |
| `BUILDKITE_BUILD_URL`    | the URL for the build on Buildkite            |
| `BUILDKITE_COMMIT`       | the commit hash for the head of the branch    |
| `BUILDKITE_JOB_ID`       | the job UUID                                  |
| `BUILDKITE_MESSAGE`      | the commit message for the head of the branch |

## CircleCI

During CircleCI workflow runs, test collectors upload information from the following environment variables:

| Environment variable | Description                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `CIRCLE_BRANCH`      | the branch or reference being built        |
| `CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM`   | the number for the job                     |
| `CIRCLE_BUILD_URL`   | the URL for the job on CircleCI            |
| `CIRCLE_SHA1`        | the commit hash for the head of the branch |
| `CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID` | the unique identifier for the workflow run |

## GitHub Actions

During GitHub Actions workflow runs, test collectors upload information from the following environment variables:

| Environment variable | Description                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GITHUB_ACTION`      | the name of the action running or its step ID           |
| `GITHUB_REF`         | the ref (branch or tag) that triggered the workflow run |
| `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`  | the repository owner and repository name                |
| `GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT` | the numbered attempt of the workflow run                |
| `GITHUB_RUN_ID`      | the unique number for the workflow run                  |
| `GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER`  | the cumulative number of runs for the workflow          |

## Other CI providers

If you're using other CI providers, then set environment variables for test collectors to use to gather information about your builds.
If you don't set these environment variables, then Test Analytics lacks the details needed to produce useful reports.

Each environment variable corresponds to a `run_env` key in the payload `https://analytics-api.buildkite.com/v1/uploads`. Read [Importing JSON](/docs/test-analytics/importing-json) to learn how these keys are used to make API calls.

<!-- what's the difference between key and number? did I get it right? -->
<!-- sha: what if they're using hg? p4? -->
<!-- are any optional? -->
