Test Analytics integrates directly with your test runner to provide in-depth information about your tests (including spans) in real time.

The beta release ships with [RSpec](docs/test-analytics/integrating-with-rspec). You you can also upload test results by importing [JSON](docs/test-analytics/importing-json) or [JUnit XML](docs/test-analytics/importing-junit-xml).
