# Test Analytics roadmap

{:notoc}

Last updated 15 June 2022.

## Now
We're working on these items now, and will have updates soon:

- **Search and filter**  
  Quickly find a test based on its title or text contents.
- **Additional test collectors**
  We'll be publishing additional collectors to bring full support for Android, Python and .NET to Test Analytics

## Next
We've got a pretty good idea of the work required for these items, and we'll be prototyping these soon:

- **Query API**  
  An API to support querying of the reliability of your suite or test
- **Quarantining flaky tests**  
  Once a test is marked as flaky, either automatically or manually, quarantine it so that test runners skip it for future runs.
- **Action your analytics**  
  Tooling to support teams who work on test suites: assign ownership, alert on changes, and track progress towards issue resolution.
- **Set goals**  
  Set goals for test suite reliability or performance over time, and trigger actions when thresholds are met.

## Later
These are areas of interest for us — we're still collecting feedback and suggestions to help shape our implementation:

- Deeper integration with Buildkite agents and Pipelines
- More ways to organise and group your tests — by namespace, filename or team, for example — so you can quickly find the patterns and data you need
- More flexible span data, to allow for profiling of different types of workload
