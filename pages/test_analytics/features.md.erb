## Find flaky tests

See which tests are most disruptive to continuous deployments, with automatic flaky test identification and analysis over time. Tests that pass on retry are marked as red/fail so you can find and fix them.

## Spot sneaky slow-downs

Find performance degradations, even in parallelized builds. Track down what's slowing down your test runs and individual test executions by viewing trends over time, and then dive deep into individual test execution span timelines to identify patterns.
