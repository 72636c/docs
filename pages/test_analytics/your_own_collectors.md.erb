# Your Own Collectors

{:notoc}

Test Analytics integrates directly with your test runner to provide in-depth information about your tests (including spans) in real time.

We currently have a [Ruby (RSpec)](/docs/test-analytics/ruby-collectors#rspec-collector) collector. However, you you can also upload test results by importing [JSON](/docs/test-analytics/importing-json) or [JUnit XML](/docs/test-analytics/importing-junit-xml).

If you're interested in building your own fully integrated analytics collector for specific test runners, have a look at our [example collector](https://github.com/buildkite/rspec-buildkite-analytics) on GitHub.
