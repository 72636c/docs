# Your Own Collectors

{:notoc}

Test Analytics integrates directly with your test runner to provide in-depth information about your tests (including spans) in real time.

We currently have [Ruby](/docs/test-analytics/ruby-collectors) and [JavaScript](/docs/test-analytics/js-collectors) collectors. Other [frameworks](/docs/test-analytics/other-collectors) are coming soon.

If you're interested in building your own fully integrated analytics collector for specific test runners, have a look at our [example collector](https://github.com/buildkite/rspec-buildkite-analytics) on GitHub.
