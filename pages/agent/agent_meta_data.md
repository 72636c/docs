# Buildkite Agent Meta-data

Each agent has meta-data tags which can be used to group and target the agents in your build pipelines. This way you're free to dynamically scale your agents and target them based on their capabilities rather than maintaining a static list.

## Setting Metadata

To set an agentâ€™s meta-data you can set it in the configuration file:

```
meta-data="docker=true,ruby2=true"
```

or with the `--meta-data` command line flag:

```
buildkite-agent start --meta-data "docker=true" --meta-data "ruby2=true"
```

or with the `BUILDKITE_AGENT_META_DATA` an environment variable:

```
env BUILDKITE_AGENT_META_DATA="docker=true,ruby2=true" buildkite-agent start
```

## Agent Targeting

Once you've started agents with metadata you can target them in the build pipeline using agent query rules.

You can match agents using exact metadata values:

<%= image 'agent-selector-matching-1.png', size: '553x353', alt: 'Agent Selector showing a single match' %>

or using the `*` wildcard value:

<%= image 'agent-selector-matching-2.png', size: '553x353', alt: 'Agent Selector showing a single match' %>

## The queue tag

The `queue` meta-data tag works differently from other tags, and can be used for isolating jobs and agents. See the [agent queues documentation](queues) for more information about using queues.
