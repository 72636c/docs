## Installation

<%= render_agent_setup :windows, nil, "v3" %>

## SSH Key Configuration

SSH keys should be copied to (or generated into) in the userâ€™s `.ssh` directory. For example, typing the following into Git Bash will generate a new private key which you can add to your source code host:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cd ~/.ssh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "build@myorg.com"
```

See the [Agent SSH Keys](/docs/agent/v3/ssh-keys) documentation for more details.

## Configuration

See the [configuration documentation](/docs/agent/v3/configuration) for an explanation of each configuration setting.

## Git for Windows

Whilst the agent will work without git installed, you will require [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) to interact with git or ssh. In addition to providing those, Bash for Windows and a variety of standard linux tools are included which are frequently required for plugins.
