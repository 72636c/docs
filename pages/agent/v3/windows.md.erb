## Installation

<%= render_agent_setup :windows, nil, "v3" %>

## SSH Key Configuration

SSH keys should be copied to (or generated into) in the userâ€™s `.ssh` directory. For example, typing the following into Git Bash will generate a new private key which you can add to your source code host:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cd ~/.ssh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "build@myorg.com"
```

See the [Agent SSH Keys](/docs/agent/v3/ssh-keys) documentation for more details.

## Configuration

See the [configuration documentation](/docs/agent/v3/configuration) for an explanation of each configuration setting.

## Git for Windows

While the agent will work without Git installed, you will require [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) to interact with Git or SSH. In addition to providing Git and SSH, Git for Windows includes Bash for Windows and a variety of standard linux tools which are frequently required for [plugins](/docs/agent/v3/plugins).
