<%= toc %>

## Installing with Powershell

```
$env:buildkiteAgentToken = "my_token"
$env:buildkiteAgentBeta = $true
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildkite/agent/master/install.ps1'))
```

## Manual Installation

<%= render_agent_setup :windows, nil, "v3" %>

## SSH Key Configuration

SSH keys should be copied to (or generated into) in the userâ€™s `.ssh` directory. For example, typing the following into Git Bash will generate a new private key which you can add to your source code host:

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "build@myorg.com"
```

See the [Agent SSH Keys](/docs/agent/v3/ssh-keys) documentation for more details.

## File Locations

* Configuration: `C:\buildkite-agent\buildkite-agent.cfg`
* Hooks: `C:\buildkite-agent\hooks`
* Builds: `C:\buildkite-agent\builds`
* SSH keys: `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh`

## Configuration

The configuration file is located at `C:\buildkite-agent\buildkite-agent.cfg`. See the [configuration documentation](/docs/agent/v3/configuration) for an explanation of each configuration setting.

## Upgrading

Rerun the install script.

## Configuration

See the [configuration documentation](/docs/agent/v3/configuration) for an explanation of each configuration setting.

## Git for Windows

While the agent will work without Git installed, you will require [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) to interact with Git or SSH. In addition to providing Git and SSH, Git for Windows includes Bash for Windows and a variety of standard linux tools which are frequently required for [plugins](/docs/agent/v3/plugins).

## Running as a service natively

The simplest way to run buildkite-agent as a service is to use a third-party tool like [nssm](https://nssm.cc/). Once installed, you can either run the GUI and configure manually, or create via the command-line:

```
nssm.exe install buildkite-agent "C:\buildkite-agent\bin\buildkite-agent.exe" "start"
nssm.exe set buildkite-agent AppStdout "C:\buildkite-agent\buildkite-agent.log"
nssm.exe set buildkite-agent AppStderr "C:\buildkite-agent\buildkite-agent.log"

nssm.exe status buildkite-agent
nssm.exe start buildkite-agent
nssm.exe status buildkite-agent
```
