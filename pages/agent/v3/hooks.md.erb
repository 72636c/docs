# Buildkite Agent Hooks

Every agent installer comes with a hooks directory which can be used to override and extend the built-in agent behavior. For example you could create a global `checkout` hook which speeds up a fresh `git clone` on a new build machine, a global `environment` hook which exports secret API keys as environment variables, or a pipeline-level `command` hook which runs the pipeline’s steps inside a custom containerized environment.

## Overview

There are two types of hooks: global hooks which exist on the agent’s machine and are the same for every pipeline, and pipeline level hooks which exist in each repository in the `.buildkite/hooks` directory.

## Available Hooks

Hooks are called in the following order:

1. `environment` (global) - runs before all other commands, useful for [exporting secret keys](/docs/agent/v3/securing#using-environment-hooks-for-secrets) etc.
1. `pre-checkout` (global) - runs before checkout
1. `checkout` (global) - overrides the default `git checkout` behavior
1. `post-checkout` (global) - runs after checkout
1. `post-checkout` (local) - runs after checkout
1. `pre-command` (global) - runs before the build command
1. `pre-command` (local) - runs before the build command
1. `command` (global) - overrides the default script running behavior, useful for changing how the command is evaluated (such as running it inside a container)
1. `post-command` (local) - runs after the command
1. `post-command` (global) - runs after the command
1. `pre-artifact` (local) - runs before artifacts are uploaded, if an artifact upload pattern was defined for the job
1. `pre-artifact` (global) - runs before artifacts are uploaded, if an artifact upload pattern was defined for the job
1. `post-artifact` (local) - runs after artifacts have been uploaded, if an artifact upload pattern was defined for the job
1. `post-artifact` (global) - runs after artifacts have been uploaded, if an artifact upload pattern was defined for the job
1. `pre-exit` (local) - runs before the job finishes, useful for performing cleanup tasks
1. `pre-exit` (global) - runs before the job finishes, useful for performing cleanup tasks

<p class="Docs__note__heading">Windows hooks</p>
These hooks work on unix-based systems with bash in the path. If you're running windows agents, you'll need some windows-specific additions to get your hooks running. See <a href="hooks#hooks-on-windows">Hooks on Windows</a> for a detailed description.</p>

## Creating Hook Scripts

Hooks are bash scripts you can use to execute commands and export environment variables. All the standard [Buildkite environment variables](/docs/builds/environment-variables) are available to be used inside your hook scripts.

The following is an example of a custom `environment` hook which exports a GitHub API key for the pipeline’s release build step:

```bash
set -eu
echo '--- \:house_with_garden\: Setting up the environment'

export GITHUB_RELEASE_ACCESS_KEY='xxx'
```

The following is an example of a custom `pre-command` hook which changes the working directory before the command is run:

```bash
set -eu
echo '--- \:sparkles\: Changing to the CI directory'

cd ci
```

## Global Hooks

Each agent installer comes with a hooks directory containing a sample set of hooks. You can find the location of your global hooks directory in your platform’s installation documentation.

To get started with global hooks copy the relevant example script and remove the `.sample` file extension.

## Pipeline Hooks

Pipeline hooks allow you to execute pipeline-specific scripts. Pipeline hooks live alongside your pipeline’s source code under the directory `.buildkite/hooks`.

To get started create a `.buildkite/hooks` directory, and your hook script, and make it executable, for example:

```bash
mkdir -p .buildkite/hooks

cat << 'HOOK_SCRIPT' > .buildkite/hooks/pre-command
set -eu
echo "--- \:checkered_flag\: Running pre-command"

echo "About to run command: $BUILDKITE_COMMAND"
HOOK_SCRIPT

chmod +x .buildkite/hooks/pre-command
```

## Hooks on Windows

Agents runnings Windows require hook files to have either:

* A `.bat` extension, and be written in [Windows Batch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file), or 
* Access to <a href="windows#git-for-windows">Git for Windows, which includes bash</a>

An example of a windows `environment.bat` hook:

```batch
@ECHO OFF
ECHO "--- :house_with_garden: Setting up the environment"
SET GITHUB_RELEASE_ACCESS_KEY='xxx'
```
