## Install the Agent on your own AWS instance

To run the agent on your own AWS instances use whichever installer matches your
instance type. For Amazon Linux 2 use the
[Red Hat/CentOS installer](/docs/agent/v3/redhat).

## Use our Elastic CI Stack for AWS

The [Elastic CI Stack for AWS](/docs/agent/v3/elastic_ci_aws) is a
CloudFormation template to deploy an autoscaling Buildkite Agent cluster. The
agent instances include Docker, S3 and CloudWatch integration.

You can an Elastic CI Stack deployment to test Linux or Windows projects,
parallelize large test suites, run Docker containers or docker-compose
integration tests, or perform any AWS ops related tasks.
