# Running Buildkite Agent on AWS

The Buildkite Agent can be run on AWS using our Elastic CI Stack for AWS.

## Install the Agent on your own AWS instance

To run the agent on your own AWS instances use whichever installer matches your
instance type. For Amazon Linux use the [Red Hat/CentOS installer].

## Use our pre-built Elastic CI Stack for AWS

The [Elastic CI Stack for AWS][github] is a pre-built CloudFormation template
that gives you an autoscaling Buildkite Agent cluster in your own AWS. The
stack includes Docker, S3 and Cloudwatch integration, and is suitable for
parallelizing large legacy test suites, testing any Linux-based project that can run within Docker, and performing AWS ops related tasks.

[Read the documentation][github] on GitHub, and launch it using the
button on your organizationâ€™s Agents page.

## Installing the Agent on mac1.metal

Now Amazon have a MacOS tier you can also run an agent on MacOS on [AWS mac1.metal](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/mac/) instances:

1. Create a [AWS mac1.metal](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/mac/) instance, making sure to configure security groups and key pairs so you can access the instance remotely.
2. Follow the [OS X installation guide](/docs/agent/v3/osx#installation) instructions for using Homebrew.


There is an excellent blog post on [running iOS agents in the cloud](https://www.starkandwayne.com/blog/buildkite-2/) that goes into more detail on automating MacOS AMIs using [Packer](https://www.packer.io/).

* You might need to give the agent [full disk access](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/issues/1400)
* Launching the agent at [boot](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/issues/1423)
