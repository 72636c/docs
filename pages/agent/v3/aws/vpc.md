# AWS VPC

AWS QuickStart https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/vpc/

Your VPC needs to provide routable access to the buildkite.com service.

This can be achieved using a public subnet, whose route table has a default
route pointing to an Internet Gateway, or using a private subnet, whose route
tableâ€™s default route points to a NAT device.

Auxiliary services used by your instances such as S3, ECR, or SSM, can be routed
over the public internet, or by using a VPC Endpoint.
