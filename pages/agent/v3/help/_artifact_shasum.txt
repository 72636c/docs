Usage:

   buildkite-agent artifact shasum [arguments...]

Description:

   Prints to STDOUT the SHA-1 for the artifact provided. If your search query
   for artifacts matches multiple agents, and error will be raised.

   Note: You need to ensure that your search query is surrounded by quotes if
   using a wildcard as the built-in shell path globbing will provide files,
   which will break the download.

Example:

   $ buildkite-agent artifact shasum "pkg/release.tar.gz" --build xxx

   This will search for all the files in the build with the path "pkg/release.tar.gz" and will
   print to STDOUT it's SHA-1 checksum.

   If you would like to target artifacts from a specific build step, you can do
   so by using the --step argument.

   $ buildkite-agent artifact shasum "pkg/release.tar.gz" --step "release" --build xxx

   You can also use the step's job id (provided by the environment variable $BUILDKITE_JOB_ID)

Options:

   --step value                Scope the search to a paticular step by using either it's name of job ID
   --build value               The build that the artifacts were uploaded to [$BUILDKITE_BUILD_ID]
   --agent-access-token value  The access token used to identify the agent [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_ACCESS_TOKEN]
   --endpoint value            The Agent API endpoint (default: "https://agent.buildkite.com/v3") [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_ENDPOINT]
   --no-color                  Don't show colors in logging [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_NO_COLOR]
   --debug                     Enable debug mode [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_DEBUG]
   --debug-http                Enable HTTP debug mode, which dumps all request and response bodies to the log [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_DEBUG_HTTP]
