## Usage

`buildkite-agent annotate [body] [options...]`

## Description

Build annotations allow you to customize the Buildkite build interface to
show information that may surface from your builds. Some examples include:

- Links to artifacts generated by your jobs
- Test result summaries
- Graphs that include analysis about your codebase
- Helpful information for team members about what happened during a build

Annotations are written in CommonMark-compliant Markdown, with "GitHub
Flavored Markdown" extensions.

The annotation body can be supplied as a command line argument, or by piping
content into the command.

You can update an existing annotation's body by running the annotate command
again and provide the same context as the one you want to update. Or if you
leave context blank, it will use the default context.

You can also update only the style of an existing annotation by omitting the
body entirely and providing a new style value.

## Example

    $ buildkite-agent annotate "All tests passed! :rocket:"
    $ cat annotation.md | buildkite-agent annotate --style "warning"
    $ buildkite-agent annotate --style "success" --context "junit"
    $ ./script/dynamic_annotation_generator | buildkite-agent annotate --style "success"

## Options

* `--context value` - The context of the annotation used to differentiate this annotation from others [`$BUILDKITE_ANNOTATION_CONTEXT`]
