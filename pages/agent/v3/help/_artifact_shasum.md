### Usage

`buildkite-agent artifact shasum [options...]`

### Description

Prints to STDOUT the SHA-1 for the artifact provided. If your search query
for artifacts matches multiple agents, and error will be raised.

Note: You need to ensure that your search query is surrounded by quotes if
using a wild card as the built-in shell path globbing will provide files,
which will break the download.

### Example

    $ buildkite-agent artifact shasum "pkg/release.tar.gz" --build xxx

This will search for all the files in the build with the path &quot;pkg/release.tar.gz&quot; and will
print the SHA-1 checksum of each one to STDOUT.

If you would like to target artifacts from a specific build step, you can do
so by using the --step argument.

    $ buildkite-agent artifact shasum "pkg/release.tar.gz" --step "release" --build xxx

You can also use the step&#39;s job id (provided by the environment variable $BUILDKITE_JOB_ID)

### Options

* `--step value` - Scope the search to a particular step by using either its name of job ID
* `--build value` - The build that the artifacts were uploaded to [`$BUILDKITE_BUILD_ID`]

* `--endpoint value` - The Agent API endpoint (default: "`https://agent.buildkite.com/v3`") [`$BUILDKITE_AGENT_ENDPOINT`]
* `--no-http2` - Disable HTTP2 when communicating with the Agent API. [`$BUILDKITE_NO_HTTP2`]
* `--debug-http` - Enable HTTP debug mode, which dumps all request and response bodies to the log [`$BUILDKITE_AGENT_DEBUG_HTTP`]
* `--no-color` - Don't show colors in logging [`$BUILDKITE_AGENT_NO_COLOR`]
* `--debug` - Enable debug mode [`$BUILDKITE_AGENT_DEBUG`]
* `--experiment value` - Enable experimental features within the buildkite-agent [`$BUILDKITE_AGENT_EXPERIMENT`]
