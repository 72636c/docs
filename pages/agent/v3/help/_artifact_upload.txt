Usage:

   buildkite-agent artifact upload [options] <pattern> [destination]

Description:

   Uploads files to a job as artifacts.

   You need to ensure that the paths are surrounded by quotes otherwise the
   built-in shell path globbing will provide the files, which is currently not
   supported.

   You can specify an alternate destination on Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage
   or Artifactory as per the examples below. This may be specified in the
   'destination' argument, or in the 'BUILDKITE_ARTIFACT_UPLOAD_DESTINATION'
   environment variable.  Otherwise, artifacts are uploaded to a
   Buildkite-managed Amazon S3 bucket.

Example:

   $ buildkite-agent artifact upload "log/**/*.log"

   You can also upload directly to Amazon S3 if you'd like to host your own artifacts:

   $ export BUILDKITE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx
   $ export BUILDKITE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=yyy
   $ export BUILDKITE_S3_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-central-1 # default is us-east-1
   $ export BUILDKITE_S3_ACL=private # default is public-read
   $ buildkite-agent artifact upload "log/**/*.log" s3://name-of-your-s3-bucket/$BUILDKITE_JOB_ID

   You can use Amazon IAM assumed roles by specifying the session token:

   $ export BUILDKITE_S3_SESSION_TOKEN=zzz

   Or upload directly to Google Cloud Storage:

   $ export BUILDKITE_GS_ACL=private
   $ buildkite-agent artifact upload "log/**/*.log" gs://name-of-your-gs-bucket/$BUILDKITE_JOB_ID

   Or upload directly to Artifactory:

   $ export BUILDKITE_ARTIFACTORY_URL=http://my-artifactory-instance.com/artifactory
   $ export BUILDKITE_ARTIFACTORY_USER=carol-danvers
   $ export BUILDKITE_ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD=xxx
   $ buildkite-agent artifact upload "log/**/*.log" rt://name-of-your-artifactory-repo/$BUILDKITE_JOB_ID
