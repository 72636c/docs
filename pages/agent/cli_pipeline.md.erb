# buildkite-agent pipeline

The Buildkite Agentâ€™s `pipeline` command allows you to add and replace build steps in the running build. The steps are defined using YML or JSON and can be read from a file or streamed from the output of a script.

See the [Uploading Build Pipelines](/docs/pipelines/uploading-pipelines) guide for a step-by-step example.

## Uploading Pipelines

```
Usage:

   buildkite-agent pipeline upload <file> [arguments...]

Description:

   Allows you to change the pipeline of a running build by uploading either a
   JSON or YAML configuration file. If no configuration file is provided,
   we look for the file in the following locations:

   - .buildkite/pipeline.yml
   - .buildkite/pipeline.json

   You can also pipe build pipelines to the command, allowing you to create scripts
   that generate dynamic pipelines.

Example:

   $ buildkite-agent pipeline upload
   $ buildkite-agent pipeline upload my-custom-steps.json
   $ ./script/dynamic_step_generator | buildkite-agent pipeline upload

Options:

   --replace                                    Replace the rest of the existing pipeline with the steps uploaded. Jobs that are already running are not removed. [$BUILDKITE_PIPELINE_REPLACE]
   --job                                        The job that is making the changes to it's build [$BUILDKITE_JOB_ID]
   --agent-access-token                         The access token used to identify the agent [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_ACCESS_TOKEN]
   --endpoint "https://agent.buildkite.com/v3"  The Agent API endpoint [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_ENDPOINT]
   --no-color                                   Don't show colors in logging [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_NO_COLOR]
   --debug                                      Enable debug mode [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_DEBUG]
   --debug-http                                 Enable HTTP debug mode, which dumps all request and response bodies to the log [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_DEBUG_HTTP]
```

## Pipeline Format

The pipeline can be written as YAML or JSON, but YAML is more commonly for its readability. There are two top level properties you can specify:

* `env` - a hash of build-wide environment variables
* `steps` - an array of build steps to be run (a mix of script, [`wait`](/docs/pipelines/wait-step) and [`block`](/docs/pipelines/block-step) steps)
