# Sharing Data Between Steps

There are two ways to share data between steps in a build: artifacts and meta-data. 

- both are available org wide?

## Build Artifacts

- artifacts are any files that are generated during a build step 
- Buildkite can host these files for you in the Buildkite artifact store
 
- you can upload and download from the store using our api
- there are limits to how much you can upload, how long we keep them for
- if you don't want Buildkite to host your files, you can use your own personal store, like s3

For an introduction to uploading and downloading from the Buildkite artifact store, see the [Using Build Artifacts](/docs/builds/artifacts) page.
For more technical information about the `buildkite-agent artifact` command and what you can do with it, see the [artifact command-line reference](/docs/agent/cli-artifact). This page also provides instructions for using your own S3 bucket.

## Build Meta-data

- key value store
- text only
- can set and get data from it
- is available across agents as well as build steps

- for usage examples, see the Using Build Meta-data page 
- to see the cli reference, go to the cli-meta-data page
