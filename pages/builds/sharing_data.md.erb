# Sharing Data Between Steps

- there are two mains ways to share data between the steps of a build: artifacts and meta-data
- both are available org wide?

<%= toc %>

## Build Artifacts

- this is a store hosted by buildkite
- can upload and download from it
- there are limits to how much you can upload, how long we keep them for
- can also use your own personal store like s3

- for an intro to uploading and downloading, see the Using Build Artifacts page
- for more technical information about the buildkite-agent artifact command and what you can do with it, see the cli-artifact page

## Build Meta-data

- key value store
- text only
- can set and get data from it
- is available across agents as well as build steps

- for usage examples, see the Using Build Meta-data page 
- to see the cli reference, go to the cli-meta-data page

## Common Use Cases For Data Sharing

### Use artifacts
- node_modules
- logs
