# Using Build Artifacts

In this guide we’ll walk through using the Buildkite Agent’s [artifact support](/docs/agent/v3/cli-artifact) to store and retrieve files between different steps in a build pipeline.

## Uploading Artifacts

To automatically upload artifacts created in a build step, set the `artifact-paths` atrribute on your command step. In this example, any artifacts that are created two levels deep under the `logs` or `coverage` directories will be uploaded automatically: 

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ":hammer: Tests"
    command:
      - "npm install"
      - "tests.sh"
    artifact_paths:
      - "logs/**/*"
      - "coverage/**/*"
```

You can also set this field in Buildkite using the “Automatic Artifact Uploading” option on a step:

<%= image 'artifact_pattern.png', size: '390x125', alt: 'Artifact pattern configuration' %> 

You can also perform an artifact upload manually in your build scripts with
the `buildkite-agent artifact` command. In this example, the file `build.tar.gz` from the `pkg` directory will be uploaded to the default destination. 

```bash
buildkite-agent artifact upload pkg/build.tar.gz
```

You can then download the artifact in subsequent build steps (even if the build step is running on a different build server).

For full documentation of the `buildkite-agent artifact upload` command, and examples of supported glob patterns, see the [buildkite-agent artifact upload documentation](/docs/agent/v3/cli-artifact#uploading-artifacts).

## Downloading Artifacts

You can download artifacts created by a build job using the `buildkite-agent artifact download` command. For example:

```bash
buildkite-agent artifact download pkg/build.tar.gz pkg/
```

If an artifact was previously uploaded at `pkg/build.tar.gz`, the above command will download it to the `pkg` directory.

The `buildkite-agent artifact` command will find the last file uploaded with the matching filename, no matter which build step uploaded it. If you want to target an artifact from a particular build step use the `--step` argument. For example:

```bash
buildkite-agent artifact download build.zip tmp/ --step build
```

This will download the `build.zip` file from the pipeline step with the label "build".

For full documentation and examples, see the [buildkite-agent artifact download documentation](/docs/agent/v3/cli-artifact#downloading-artifacts).

## Downloading Artifacts Outside a Running Build

The `buildkite-agent artifact download` command only works within the context of a running build.

If you want to download an artifact from outside a build use our [Artifact Download API](/docs/api/artifacts#download-an-artifact).

## Further documentation

See the [Buildkite Agent artifact documentation](/docs/agent/v3/cli-artifact) for a full list of options and details of Buildkite’s artifact support.
