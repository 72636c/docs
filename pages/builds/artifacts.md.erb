# Using Build Artifacts

In this guide we’ll walk through using the Buildkite Agent’s [artifact support](/docs/agent/v2/cli-artifact) to store and retrieve files between different steps in a build pipeline.

## Uploading Artifacts

By default the agent will upload any artifacts you’ve specified in your build
step’s “Artifact Uploading” pattern:

<%= image 'artifact_pattern.png', size: '390x125', alt: 'Artifact pattern configuration' %>

You can also upload your own artifacts from your build scripts using
the `buildkite-agent artifact` command.

```bash
buildkite-agent artifact upload pkg/build.tar.gz
```

You can then download the artifact in subsequent build steps (even if the build step is running on a different build server).

For full documentation, and examples of supported glob patterns, see the [buildkite-agent artifact upload documentation](/docs/agent/v2/cli-artifact#uploading-artifacts).

## Downloading Artifacts

You can download artifacts created by a build job using the `buildkite-agent artifact download` command. For example:

```bash
buildkite-agent artifact download pkg/build.tar.gz pkg/
```

If an artifact was previously uploaded at `pkg/build.tar.gz`, the above command will download it to the `pkg` directory.

The `buildkite-agent artifact` command will find the last file uploaded with the matching filename, no matter which build step uploaded it. If you want to target an artifact from a particular build step use the `--step` argument. For example:

```bash
buildkite-agent artifact download build.zip tmp/ --step build
```

This will download the `build.zip` file from the pipeline step with the label "build".

For full documentation and examples, see the [buildkite-agent artifact download documentation](/docs/agent/v2/cli-artifact#downloading-artifacts).

## Downloading Artifacts Outside a Running Build

The `buildkite-agent artifact download` command only works within the context of a running build.

If you want to download an artifact from outside a build use our [Artifact Download API](/docs/api/artifacts#download-an-artifact).

## Further documentation

See the [Buildkite Agent artifact documentation](/docs/agent/v2/cli-artifact) for a full list of options and details of Buildkite’s artifact support.
