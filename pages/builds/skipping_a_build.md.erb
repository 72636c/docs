# Skipping a Build

Some code changes don't really require a full build - editing documentation for example.
If you want Buildkite to ignore a commit and not build it, simply add `[ci skip]` or `[skip ci]` somewhere in the commit message.
Buildkite won't build this commit or store it in the build history.

In GitHub, it would look something like this:

<%= image "github_example.png" %>
