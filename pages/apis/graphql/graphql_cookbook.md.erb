## Get all environment variables set on a build

Retrieve all of a job's environment variables for a given build. This is the equivalent of what you see on the _Environment_ tab.

```graphql
query GetEnvVarsBuild {
  build(slug:"organization-slug/pipeline-slug/build-number") {
    message
    jobs(first: 10, state:FINISHED) {
      edges {
        node {
          ... on JobTypeCommand {
            label
            env
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Get a list of recently created pipelines

Get a list of the 500 most recently created pipelines.

```graphql
query RecentPipelineSlugs {
  organization(slug: "organization-slug") {
    pipelines(first: 500) {
      edges {
        node {
          slug
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Get the creation date of the most recent build in every pipeline

Get the creation date of the most recent build in every pipeline. Use pagination to handle large responses. Buildkite sorts builds by newest first.

Get the first 500:

```graphql
query {
  organization(slug: "organization-slug") {
    pipelines(first: 500) {
      count
      pageInfo {
        endCursor
        hasNextPage
      }
      edges {
        node {
          name
          slug
          builds(first: 1) {
            edges {
              node {
                createdAt
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then, if there are more than 500 results, use the value of `organization.pipelines.pageInfo.endCursor` to get the next page:

```graphql
query {
  organization(slug: "organization-slug") {
    pipelines(first: 500, after: "value-from-organization.pipelines.pageInfo.endCursor") {
      count
      pageInfo {
        endCursor
        hasNextPage
      }
      edges {
        node {
          name
          slug
          builds(first: 1) {
            edges {
              node {
                createdAt
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Get all jobs in a given queue for a given timeframe

Get all jobs in a named queue, created on or after a given date. Note that if you want all jobs in the default queue, you do not need to set a queue name.


```graphql
query PipelineRecentBuildLastJobQueue {
  organization(slug: "organization-slug") {
    pipelines(first: 500) {
      edges {
        node {
          slug
          builds(first: 1) {
            edges {
              node {
                number
                jobs(state: FINISHED, first: 1, agentQueryRules: "queue=queue-name", createdAtFrom: "DateTime") {
                  edges {
                    node {
                      ... on JobTypeCommand {
                        uuid
                        agentQueryRules
                        createdAt
                      }
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
        endCursor
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Count the number of builds on a branch

Count how many builds a pipeline has done for a given repository branch.

```graphql
query PipelineBuildCountForBranchQuery {
  pipeline(slug:"organization-slug/pipeline-slug") {
    builds(branch:"branch-name") {
      count
    }
  }  
}
```

You can limit the results to a certain timeframe using `createdAtFrom` or `createdAtTo`:

```graphql
query PipelineBuildCountForBranchQuery {
  pipeline(slug:"organization-slug/pipeline-slug") {
    builds(branch:"branch-name", createdAtTo:"DateTime") {
      count
    }
  }  
}
```

## List organization members

List the first 100 members in the organization:

```graphql
query getOrgMembers{
  organization(slug: "organization-slug") {
    members(first: 100) {
      edges {
        node {
          role
          user {
            name
            email
            id
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Get the most recent SSO sign-in for all users

Use this to get the last sign-in date for users in your organization, if your organization has SSO enabled.

```graphql{
  organization(slug: "organization-slug") {
    members(first: 100) {
      edges {
        node {
          user {
            name
            email
          }
          sso {
            authorizations(first: 1) {
              edges {
                node {
                  createdAt
                  expiredAt
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Search for an organization member by email address

Get details of a single organization member by their email address.

```graphql
query getOrgMember{
  organization(slug: "starfall-projects") {
    members(first: 1, search: "user-email") {
      edges {
        node {
          role
          user {
            name
            email
            id
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Get a list of agent token IDs

```graphql
query token {
  organization(slug: "organization-slug") {
    id
    name
    agentTokens(first: 5) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          description
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Set teams' pipeline edit access to READ_ONLY or BUILD_AND_READ

Remove edit access from existing teams. This is helpful when you want to centralize pipeline edit permissions to a single system user, controlled by an organization admin.

First, walk through all teams:

```graphqlquery Teams {
  organization(slug: "organization-slug") {
    teams(first: 500) {
      edges {
        node {
          slug
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then, get the team pipeline IDs from the team slugs. Use the `id` returned here as the `team-pipeline-id` in the next step.

```graphql
query TeamPipelineIDs {
  team(slug: "organization-slug/team-slug") {
    pipelines(first: 500) {
      edges {
        node {
          id 
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Finally, update all pipelines in a team to have either READ_ONLY or BUILD_AND_READ access:

```graphql
mutation UpdateTeamPipelineReadonly {
  teamPipelineUpdate(input: {
    id: "team-pipeline-id",
    accessLevel: BUILD_AND_READ
  }) {
    teamPipeline {
      permissions {
        teamPipelineDelete {
          allowed
          code
          message
        }
        teamPipelineUpdate {
          allowed
          code
          message
        }
      }
    }
    clientMutationId
  }
}
```

## Add an existing organization user to a team

First, get a list of teams in the organization, to get the team ID:

```graphql
query getOrgTeams {
  organization(slug: "starfall-projects") {
    teams(first: 500) {
      edges {
        node {
          name
          id
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then, add a team member. You can get the `user-id` using the example in [Search organization members](#search-organization-members).

<section class="Docs__note">
<code>clientMutationId</code> is null when the mutation is successful.
</section>

```graphql
mutation addTeamMember{
  teamMemberCreate(input: {teamID: "team-id", userID: "user-id"}) {
    clientMutationId
  }
}
```

## Create a user, add them to a team, and set user permissions

Invite a new user to the organization, add them to a team, and set their role.

Log in to your organization, then get the organization ID from  _Settings_ > _GraphQL API Integration_, and team ID from _Settings_ > _Teams_ > _team-name_ > _Settings_.

```graphql
mutation CreateUser {
  organizationInvitationCreate(input: {
    organizationID: "organization-id",
    emails: ["user-email"],
    role: MEMBER,
    teams: [
      {
        id: "team-id",
        role: MAINTAINER
      }
    ]
  }) {
    invitationEdges {
      node {
        email
        createdAt
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Create a team

Create a new team.

First, get the organization ID:

```graphql
query getOrganizationId {
  organization(slug: "organization-slug") {
    id
  }
}
```

Then use the ID to create a new team within the organization:

```graphql
mutation CreateTeam {
  teamCreate(input: {
    organizationID: "organization-id",
    name: "team-name",
    privacy: SECRET,
    isDefaultTeam: false,
    defaultMemberRole: MEMBER
  }) {
    organization {
      uuid
      teams(first: 1, order: RECENTLY_CREATED) {
        count
        edges {
          node {
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Remove a team member

This deletes a user from a team, but not from the organization.

First, get a list of teams and members, to get the team IDs and current memberships.

```graphql
query TeamMembersQuery {
  organization(slug: "organization-slug") {
    teams(first: 500) {
      edges {
        node {
          name
          id
          members(first: 100) {
            edges {
              node {
                role
                id
                user {
                  name
                  email
                  id
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then delete a team member. Check that you have the team member ID and not the user ID.

<section class="Docs__note">
<code>clientMutationId</code> is null when the mutation is successful.
</section>

```graphql
mutation deleteTeamMember {
  teamMemberDelete(input: {id: "team-member-id"}) {
    clientMutationId
  }
}
```

## Delete a pipeline

First, get the ID of the pipeline you want to delete:

```graphql
query {
  pipeline(slug:"organization-slug/pipeline-slug") {
    id
  }
}
```

Then, use the ID to delete the pipeline:

```graphql
mutation PipelineDelete {
  pipelineDelete(input: {
    id: "pipeline-id"
  })
  {
    deletedPipelineID
  }
}
```

## Increase the next build number

Set the number for the next build to run in this pipeline.

First, get the pipeline ID:

```graphql
query PipelineId {
  pipeline(slug: "organization-slug/pipeline-slug") {
    id
  }
}
```

Then mutate the next build number. In this example, we set `nextBuildNumber` to 300:

```graphql
mutation PipelineUpdate {
  pipelineUpdate(input: {
  id: "pipeline-id",
  nextBuildNumber: 300
  }) {
    pipeline {
      name 
      nextBuildNumber
    }
  }
}
```

## Delete an organization member

This deletes a member from an organization. It does not delete their Buildkite user account.

First, find the member's ID:

```graphql
query {
  organization(slug: "organization-slug") {
    members(search: "organization-member-name", first: 10) {
      edges {
        node {
          role
          user {
            name
          }
          id
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

Then, use the ID to delete the user:

```graphql
mutation deleteOrgMember {
  organizationMemberDelete(input: { id: "organization-member-id" }){
    organization{
      name
    }
    deletedOrganizationMemberID
    user{
        name
    }
  }
}
```
