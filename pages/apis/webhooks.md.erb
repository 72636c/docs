# Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to monitor and respond to events within your Buildkite organization, providing a real time view of activity and allowing you to extend and integrate Buildkite into your systems.

Webhooks can be added and configured on your [organization's Notification Services settings](https://buildkite.com/organizations/-/services) page.

  <tr><th>build.running</th><td><%= webhook_description "build.running" %></td></tr>
  <tr><th>build.finished</th><td><%= webhook_description "build.finished" %></td></tr>
  <tr><th>job.scheduled</th><td><%= webhook_description "job.scheduled" %></td></tr>
  <tr><th>job.started</th><td><%= webhook_description "job.started" %></td></tr>
  <tr><th>job.finished</th><td><%= webhook_description "job.finished" %></td></tr>
  <tr><th>job.activated</th><td><%= webhook_description "job.activated" %></td></tr>
  <tr><th>agent.connected</th><td><%= webhook_description "agent.connected" %></td></tr>
  <tr><th>agent.lost</th><td><%= webhook_description "agent.lost" %></td></tr>
  <tr><th>agent.disconnected</th><td><%= webhook_description "agent.disconnected" %></td></tr>
  <tr><th>agent.stopping</th><td><%= webhook_description "agent.stopping" %></td></tr>
  <tr><th>agent.stopped</th><td><%= webhook_description "agent.stopped" %></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## HTTP headers

The following HTTP headers are present in every webhook request, which allow you to identify the event that took place, and to verify the authenticity of the request:

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr><th><code>X-Buildkite-Event</code></th><td>The type of event<p class="Docs__api-param-eg"><em>Example:</em> <code>build.scheduled</code></p></td></tr>
  <tr><th><code>X-Buildkite-Token</code></th><td>The token from your webhook configuration settings, used to verify the authenticity of the webhook request<p class="Docs__api-param-eg"><em>Example:</em> <code>309c9c842d8565adec5d7469160059f9</code></p></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## HTTP request body

Each event’s data is sent JSON encoded in the request body. See each event’s documentation to see which keys are available in the payload. For example:

```json
{
  "event": "build.started",
  "build": {
    "keys": "vals"
  },
  "sender": {
    "keys": "vals"
  }
}
```

## Example implementations

The following example repositories show how to receive a webhook event and trigger a LIFX powered build light. You can browse their source, fork them, and deploy them to Heroku directly from their GitHub readmes, or simply use them as an example to implement webhooks in your tool of choice.

## Request logs

The last 50 webhook request and responses are saved, so you can debug and inspect your webhook. Each webhook’s request logs are available on the bottom of their settings page.
