Where Buildkite Pipelines help you automate your build pipelines,
Test Analytics helps you track and analyze the steps in that pipeline that involve tests:

- Ship code to production faster by optimizing test suites
- Works with any continuous integration
- Identify, fix, and monitor test suite performance
- Track, improve, and monitor test suite reliability
