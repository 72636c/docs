# Emoji

Buildkite supports over 300 custom emoji which you can use in your Pipelines and terminal output.

To use an emoji, write the name of the emoji in between colons, like `\:buildkite\:` which shows up as :buildkite:.

A few common emoji are listed below, but you can see the [full list of available emoji](https://github.com/buildkite/emojis#emoji-reference) on GitHub.
