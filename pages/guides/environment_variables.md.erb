# Environment Variables

When the agent invokes your build scripts it passes in a set of standard Buildkite environment variables, along with any that you've defined in your build configuration.

## Defining your own

You can define environment variables in your jobs in two ways:

* In the build pipeline configuration (useful for values that are not secret)
* Using the `environment` or `pre-command` [agent hook](/docs/agent/hooks) (useful for values that are secret, or agent-specific)
