# Getting Started

This guide will help you setup your first Buildkite project. We’ll use GitHub, but Buildkite can work with any version control system.

## Sign up

The first step is to [sign up](<%= url_helpers.signup_path %>) for a Buildkite account—every account gets a 14 day trial.

## Start an Agent

Following the instructions on your agent page to install and start an agent on any machine you like (including your development machine).

## Choose the app you want to build

For the purpose of getting up to speed quickly, we’ve created test repository that that you can use. Or you can use your own application, you’ll just need to create a build script for the agent to run.

Go to: https://github.com/buildkite/bash-example and fork the repository.

## Create a new project

Click **Create Project** on your Organization page.

<%= image("create-project-dashboard.png") %>

Enter the name: "bash-example" and paste in the git URL of your project:

<%= image("create-new-project.png") %>

Now, we need to tell Buildkite what script to run for the build.

Here, we use `example_script.sh` as that’s the script that triggers the build process in our example.

Once you’re done, click **Create Project**

## Add the webhook to the GitHub repository

If you want Buildkite to automatically test new commits and pull requests you’ll need to setup the webhook. This step is optional, because we can manually trigger a build below.

## Trigger a build

Now that we’ve created our project, let’s trigger a build. You can do this with a commit (thanks to the webhook you’ve set up above), or with the **Trigger build** button:

<%= image("trigger-build.png") %>

If all goes to plan, you should see a green build.

<%= image("green-build.png") %>

And you’re done!
