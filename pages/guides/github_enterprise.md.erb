# GitHub Enterprise

Buildkite can connect to your GitHub Enterprise installation and use the Commit Status API to update the status of commits in Pull Requests.

## Register Buildkite as a new application

Go to your GitHub Enterprise installation, and start by registering a new **Developer application**. This can
be done by going to your **GitHub User Settings**, clicking **Applications** on the left, thne selecting **Developer applications** at the top:

<%= image("github-user-settings.png", size: '301x326') %>

<%= image("applications-menu.png", size: '343x157') %>

From this page, click **Register new application**

<%= image("register-application-button.png") %>

Fill out the form with the following:

**Name**

`Buildkite`

**URL**

`https://buildkite.com`

**Callback URL**

`https://buildkite.com/user/authorize/github_enterprise/callback`

Here's an image you can use:

<%= image("buildkite-square.png", size: '100x100') %>

Once filled out, click the **Register application** button at the bottom of the form:

<%= image("register-application.png") %>

Now that we've created an application, we have access to the Client ID and Client Secret. We'll need those to setup your GitHub Enterprise installation on Buildkite.

## Update your Buildkite organization settings

Go to the **Settings** page of the organization you'd like to connect to your GitHub Enterprise installation to:

<%= image("account-settings.png", size: '268x94') %>

Scroll down to see your **GitHub Enterprise** settings. Copy the Client ID, Client Secret, and the URL of your GitHub Enterprise Installation to this form, then press **Save GitHub Enterprise Settings**.

<%= image("setup-enterprise.png") %>

Once saved, the last step is to authorize your GitHub Enterprise user account with Buildkite.

## Connect your GitHub Enterprise account

So Buildkite can mark commits and pull requests as pass or fail, you'll need to authorize your GitHub Enterprise user account with Buildkite.

Go to your "Connected Accounts" settings page (<%= url_helpers.user_authorizations_url %>). Here you'll see your GitHub Enterprise Installation
as an option to connect to. Click **Connect**.

<%= image("oauth.png", size: '546x222') %>

You should be redirected back to your GitHub Enterprise Installation, where it will ask you to authorize Buildkite with your account. Click the **Authorize application** button at the bottom.

<%= image("oauth-connect.png") %>

That's it! Next time you create a project with a repository that's either `https://git.mycompany.com/acme/app.git` or `git@git.mycompany.com:acme/app.git`,
Buildkite will recognize that it's hosted on your GitHub Enterprise Installation, and use the your newly created oAuth authorization to update the commit statuses.

## Firewalled Installs

If your GitHub Enterprise is behind a firewall you’ll need to whitelist Buildkite’s network to perform oAuth authentication and post to the Commit Status API.

The IP address you’ll need to whitelist is `54.165.103.71`
