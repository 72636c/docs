# OAuth with Google G Suite

Google's G Suite (previously Google Apps) can be used to authorize access to your Buildkite organisation. G Suite doesn't proivide group management, as it uses OAuth rather than SAML to perform the authorization.

## Setting up OAuth

Setting up G Suite to log in to Buildkite is a short process, requiring an email to the Buildkite team and a test of the new login flow.

### Email the Buildkite team
1. Send an email to support@buildkite.com with the following information:

    <dl>
        <dt>Domain name</dt>
        <dd>
          The domain you use with Google G Suite for which you want to enable OAuth. This must match one of the emails you have verified with your Buildkite account.
        </dd>
        <dt>Organisation slug</dt>
        <dd>
          The Buildkite organisation for which you want to enable OAuth.  
        </dd>
        <dt>Disclose hosted domain during SSO</dt>
        <dd>
            Whether or not you'd like your users to see your domain name during the SSO process. 
        </dd>
    </dl>

1. Ensure all members of the specified organisation have an email address with that domain verified in their Buildkite account

When we receive your email, the Buildkite team will:

1. Enable OAuth for the specified organisation
1. Reply to your email and get you to test that it's all working
1. Deauthorize all the users in the organisation, so that everyone will authorize via Google next time they attempt to access that organisation on Buildkite.com
