# SSO with Okta

- Teams using Okta can use it to log into Buildkite

## Setting up SSO
- sso setup ocurrs on both sides, in the okta and buildkite organisations
- an organisation admin sets up okta with the buildkite app
- the buildkite team enables sso for your organisation, with the details you provide
- Okta does provide support for 'groups', and this needs to be set up inside Okta

### Setup on the Okta website
1. go to admin section
1. select 'add applications' to search the Okta application directory
1. search for Buildkite
1. add the Buildkite app to your Okta account
1. fill out the form, entering your Buildkite organisation slug as the 'organisation id' (this is case sensitive)
1. in the Buildkite application in Okta, select the 'Sign on' tab
1. In the sign on 'settings' section, click the 'view setup instructions' button
1. follow the configuration instructions 

### What the Buildkite team will do
1. enable sso for the specified organisation
1. get you to test that it's all working
1. force a logout for all the users in the organisation, so that everyone will log in via Okta next time they access Buildkite.com
