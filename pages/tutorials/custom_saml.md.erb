# SAML with a Custom Provider

Teams using a SAML provider that isn't covered by any of the Buildkite SSO guides can manually set up a custom provider.

## Setting up SAML

- meta data is provided for setting up SAML with any provider

1. Fetch the XML from this URL: https://buildkite.com/user/authorize/saml/metadata
2. Using the meta data from the XML, set up Buildkite in your SAML provider's service
    - the Buildkite SSO service accepts the `username` and `admin` fields
3. Email support@buildkite

### What the Buildkite team will do
1. enable SAML for the specified organisation
1. get you to test that it's all working
1. force a logout for all the users in the organisation, so that everyone will log in via your chosen provider next time they access Buildkite.com
