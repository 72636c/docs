# SAML with a Custom Provider

Any identify provider that supports SAML 2.0 can be used to authorize access to your Buildkite organisation. If there isn't a Buildkite guide for your chosen provider, you can set up SAML using the instructions below.

## Set-up your provider

- there are two ways to set up your custom provider: using the Buildkite metadata, or manually entering your Buildkite data
- once you have set up your provider, you'll need to send the provider information to Buildkite

Self-service SSO provisioning in Buildkite is available via our GraphQL explorer. For further information, see the [GraphQL SSO Setup Guide](/docs/tutorials/graphql-sso). 

Before starting your provider setup:
Email the Buildkite team at support@buildkite.com to request your unique SSO service URL, you will need this when setting up your identity provider.

### Setting up with Meta data

The Buildkite SAML meta data endpoint contains all the information you need to set up SAML with any provider.

To set up your provider using meta data:

1. Fetch the XML from this URL: <a href="https://buildkite.com/user/authorize/saml/metadata">https://buildkite.com/user/authorize/saml/metadata</a>
2. Using the meta data from the XML, set up Buildkite in your identity provider's service. Buildkite accepts the user attributes `admin`, `name`, `email`, and `teams` in the SAML assertion.

### Setting up manually

Manual setup with your identity provider usually requires the following fields:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Single Sign-On URL</td>
        <td>
            Your unique SSO service URL from Buildkite that will be sending requests to your identity provider. 
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Entity Identifier</td>
        <td>
            https://buildkite.com  
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Name ID</td>
        <td>
            The field used to identify users.
            Email Address.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

If your custom provider needs further information, please email support@buildkite.com.

## Send your application information to Buildkite

Email support@buildkite with the following information:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Domain name</td>
        <td>
            The domain you use with your SAML provider for which you want to enable SSO. This must match one of the emails you have verified with your Buildkite account.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Organisation slug</td>
        <td>
            The Buildkite organisation for which you want to enable SSO.  
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)</td>
        <td>
            The SAML endpoint for your chosen provider.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Issuer URL</td>
        <td>
            The identifing URL of your chosen provider.  
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>X.509 certificate</td>
        <td>
            The public key certificate for your chosen provider.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

When we receive your email, the Buildkite team will:

1. Enable SSO for the specified organisation
1. Reply to your email and get you to test that it's all working
1. Deauthorize all the users in the organisation, so that everyone will authorize via your chosen provider next time they attempt to access that organisation on Buildkite.com
