# Controlling permissions with Teams

Enabling Teams for your organisations gives you fine grained control over the permissions for each of your pipelines.


- must be in a team to create a pipeline (everyone starts in the everyone team)

- default teams for new users (the 'automatically add users to this team' checlbox in the team settings)
- can invite people to a team (use the add member button on the members page of a team)

All users in a team have the same level of access to the pipelines in their team. If you need to have more fine grained control over the pipelines in a team, you can create more teams with different permissions. 

- maintainer can add and remove people and pipelines from their team (as long as they have access to the pipeline in another team)

## Organisation level permissions

Users who are organisaion admins can:
- enable and disable teams for their organisation
- create new teams

## Team level permissions

Users who are team maintainers can:
- add users to existing teams, of which they are the maintainer
- remove users from their teams
- set read, write, and edit permissions for users on pipelines in their team

can be one, two, or all of these for different purposes, these are per pipeline inside a team

- if you have all the permissions on a pipeline you can give access to it to a team you're a part of, or if the team is visible

## Programmatically managing teams

- graphQL api
- lock down agents using the teams env var


## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will users (and API tokens) still have access to their pipelines?
When you enable Teams we’ll create a default team called “Everyone”, containing all your users and pipelines. This ensures that users, and their API tokens, will still have access to their pipelines.

### How does Teams work with SSO?
When a user joins the organization via SSO, they’ll be automatically added to any teams that have the “Automatically add new users to this team” setting enabled.

### Can I delete the “Everyone” team?
Yes you can delete or edit the “Everyone” team. To ensure uniterrupted access to pipelines we recommend creating new teams before deleting the “Everyone” team.

###Once enabled, can I disable Teams?
You can disable teams by deleting all your teams, and then selecting “Disable Teams”.
