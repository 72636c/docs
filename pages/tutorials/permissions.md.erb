# Controlling permissions with Teams

Enabling Teams for your organisations gives you fine grained control over the permissions for each of your pipelines.


- default teams for new users
- can invite people to a team
- everyone in a team has the same permissions (except the maintainer), to do more fine grained, add more teams
- maintainer can add and remove people and pipelines from their team (as long as they have access to the pipeline in another team)


## Team level permissions

Users who are team maintainers can:
- add users to existing teams of which they are the maintainer
- set read, write, and build permissions for users on pipelines in their team


can be one, two, or all of these for different purposes, these are per pipeline inside a team


## Organisation level permissions

Agents sit outside the teams structure, and cannot be restricted to specific teams. 

Users who are organisaion admins can:
- update organisation-wide permissions
- create new agents
- create new teams
