# Migrating to the YAML pipeline editor

- migrating from the UI editor to the YAML editor
- the web-based step editor is deprecated, this guide will get your pipelines running with the new YAML editor

{:toc}

## What changes

- if you've been using the YAML steps editor beta, nothing changes for you
- instead of managing your pipeline steps with the GUI-like editor, your pipeline will be managed in YAML in a code editing window (screenshot)
- after migrating, the web-based step editor will no longer be available

- example YAML code for each step type is available in the reference sidebar

### Compatability issues



## Steps to migrate

- need to be an org admin, can see which pipelines are already migrated on the pipeline management page
