# Introduction to SSO with Buildkite

Single sign-on (SSO) provides authentication or authorisation to a third party site like Buildkite by means of a token from your identity provider.

## What types of SSO does Builkite support?

Buildkite organizations can perform SSO using any identity provider that supports SAML 2.0. OAuth using Google G Suite or Github is also supported.

Buildkite SSO Guides help you to get SSO set up with popular providers, and a Custom SAML provider guide is available for all other identity providers. 

## How does SSO work with accounts and organizations?

SSO is an organization-level option, and can be enabled by an organization admin for one domain per organization. 

If an organization that you're a member of enables SSO, it will not affect your personal Buildkite account login details. When you access pipelines or anything owned by the organization, you'll be directed through their chosen provider's SSO authentication flow. 

To access an organization's content using SSO, you'll first need: 

* A Buildkite account
* An email address containing your team's domain

The email address with your team's domain name must be a verified email in your personal Buildkite account before you will be able to access the organization's content. Each user must have a unique email address. 

Organizations admins will no longer need to 'invite' users to join their organization, any Buildkite user with an authorised email address will be be to use their identity provider to gain access to the organization's content. 

## How do I enable SSO for my organization?

- email support, or use graphql

- there's a bit of back and forth involved in setting up sso
- setup happens on both sides, Buildkite and your identity provider
- need to get your issuer url from Buildkite, complete your identity provider setup, then complete the sso setup with Buildkite

### Setting up your identity provider

- there are guides available for setting up Buildkite as an application in your identity provider: google, okta, onelogin, ad fs, and a general saml guide for custom identity providers

### Setting up SSO in Buildkite

- can email support@bk and we'll send you your issuer url
- once you've set up your id provider, you send us the rest of the info and we complete your setup

- otherwise, you can complete the Buildkite side yourself using the GraphQL explorer
- check out our guide on completing this process

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can some people in the organization use SSO and others not?
No, if SSO is enabled, all of the users in your organization will be required to authorise with your chosen identity provider.

### What happens if a user leaves an organization?
If the user no longer has access to the email address at the team's domain, they will not be able to access the organization's content. This will not affect access to the user's personal account or any other organization they're a member of.  

### Can we enable SSO on multiple domains for one organization?
No, we currently support only one domain per organization.

### Is there downtime for my organization while SSO is enabled?
No, there'll be no downtime. Buildkite will deauthorise all your users, and they will be required to authorise with your chosen identity provider when they next try to access your organization.

### Will enabling SSO cause a service interruption?
No, all of your builds/agents/pipelines will continue to run as normal.

### Can the SSO testing and user deauthorisation be scheduled for a specific time?
Yes, within Australian business hours. 

### Is there a self-service SSO enablement option?
Yes, if you're comfortable using GraphQL, you can enable SSO yourself for your organization. Check out our GraphQL SSO guide. 

### Does enabling SSO affect billing?
No, enabling SSO will not affect how much you are billed. However, whenever a new user signs in to Buildkite using SSO, they will be added to your organization as if you had invited them.
