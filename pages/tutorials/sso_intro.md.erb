# Intro to SSO with Buildkite

<%= toc %>

## What does Builkite support

- can do both oauth and saml
- there are guides for popular providers available for setting up your organisation with sso, but we support any identity provider that has support for SAML 2.0 and have a custom saml provider guide

## How does SSO work with accounts and organisations

- your buildkite account is separate from any organsiation that you are a part of
- organisations can enable sso for authorisation, it's only available at the organisational level
- you will still retain your buildkite login details, then you'll have an additional layer of authorisation to access your organisation's content
- if a user of your identity provider tries to log into buildkite, they will set up their Buildkite account after they have completed the authorisation? 

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can some people in the organisation use SSO and others not?
No, if SSO is enabled, all of the users in your organisation will be required to authorise with your chosen identity provider.

### Can we enable SSO on multiple domains for one organisation?
No, we currently support only one domain per organisation.

### Is there downtime while SSO is enabled?
No, there'll be no downtime. Buildkite will deauthorise all your users, and they will be required to authorise with your chosen identity provider when they next try to access your organisation.

### Will enabling SSO cause a service interruption?
No, all of your builds/agents/pipelines will continue to run as normal.

### Can the SSO testing/deauthorisation be scheduled for a specific time?
Yes, within Australian business hours.
