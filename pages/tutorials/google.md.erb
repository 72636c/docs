# OAuth with Google G Suite

Google's G Suite can be used as single sign-on to log in to your organsiation's Buildkite account. G Suite doesn't proivide group management, as it uses OAuth rather than SAML to perform the login.  

## Setting up OAuth

Setting up G Suite to log in to Buildkite is a short process, requiring an email to the Buildkite team and some testing.

### Email the Buildkite team
1. Send an email to support@buildkite.com with the following information:
 - Your domain name: this is the domain that you have in your email address, and it must be the same domain that uses Google G Suite
 - The slug of the organisation for which you want to enable OAuth 
1. Ensure all members of the specified organisation have an email address with that domain verified in their Buildkite account

When we receive your email, the Buildkite team will:

1. Enable OAuth for the specified organisation
1. Reply to your email and get you to test that it's all working
1. Force a logout for all the users in the organisation, so that everyone will log in via Google next time they attempt to access that organisation on Buildkite.com
