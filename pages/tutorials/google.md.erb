# OAuth with Google G Suite

- Teams using Google G Suite can use it to log into Buildkite

## Setting up OAuth

### Pre-requisites
1. send the buildkite team:
 - your domain name (this is the domain that your team has in their email addresses, and it must be the same domain that uses google g suite)
 - the slug of the organisation you want to enable oauth for 
1. ensure your team members have this email address verified in their buildkite account

### What does Buildkite do
1. enable oauth for the specified organisation
1. get you to test that it's all working
1. force a logout for all the users in the organisation, so that everyone will log in via Google next time they access Buildkite.com
