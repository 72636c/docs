# OAuth with Google G Suite

Google's G Suite can be used as single sign-on to log in to your Buildkite organisation. G Suite doesn't proivide group management, as it uses OAuth rather than SAML to perform the login.  

## Setting up OAuth

Setting up G Suite to log in to Buildkite is a short process, requiring an email to the Buildkite team and testing the new login flow.

### Email the Buildkite team
1. Send an email to support@buildkite.com with the following information:

    <dl>
        <dt>Domain name</dt>
        <dd>
          The domain you use with Google G Suite for which you want to enable OAuth. This must match one of the emails you have verified with your Buildkite account.
        </dd>
        <dt>Organisation slug</dt>
        <dd>
          The Buildkite organisation for which you want to enable OAuth.  
        </dd>
    </dl>

1. Ensure all members of the specified organisation have an email address with that domain verified in their Buildkite account

When we receive your email, the Buildkite team will:

1. Enable OAuth for the specified organisation
1. Reply to your email and get you to test that it's all working
1. Force a logout for all the users in the organisation, so that everyone will log in via Google next time they attempt to access that organisation on Buildkite.com
