# Migrating to YAML Steps

This guide will explain the differences between the web-based editor and the YAML Steps editor, and provides steps for completing the migration for your organization's pipelines.

## What changes when you migrate

Instead of creating and managing pipeline steps with the GUI-like step editor, pipelines will be managed in YAML in the YAML Steps editor.  

There are two parts to migrating: 
1. Opt-in to using YAML Steps for any new pipelines created by your organization
1. Migrate all existing pipelines, either one at a time or using the bulk migration button

After migrating to YAML Steps, you will no longer be able to access the web-based step editor.

A new reference sidebar is available alongside the YAML editor. Each step type lists the available top level attributes with short descriptions, for more detailed information on each you can click through to the relevant documentation page

If you've been using the YAML steps editor during its beta, none of your pipelines will have any changes applied.

## Using YAML Steps for new pipelines

To use the YAML Steps editor for new pipelines created in your organization, you'll need to opt-in on the Pipeline YAML Migration page in Organization Settings.

Clicking the button to start using YAML pipelines won't change anything for any existing pipelines in your organization. Migration of existing pipelines will need to be completed either individually or using the bulk migration tool. See the migration instructions below for further information.  

## Steps to migrate existing pipelines

The migration page can be accessed by organization administrators from the Organization Settings page. On this page you can see which pipelines have already been migrated and which are yet to migrate. 

### Individual migration

You can migrate each pipeline individually from the Pipeline Settings page. Under the web-based Steps editor is a button to Convert to YAML Steps:

<%= image "individual-migration.png", width: 1730/2, height: 1086/2, alt: "Screenshot of the YAML Steps conversion panel and button" %>

Click this button to automatically convert your pipeline steps into YAML. The new YAML steps version of your pipeline will be auto-saved during migration, and will replace the web-based steps.

If you expect to have compatability issues with your environment variables, individual migration is recommended. 

### Bulk migration

You can migrate all of the pipelines in your organization at the same time using the bulk migration button on the migration page.

<%= image "bulk-migration.png", width: 1744/2, height: 446/2, alt: "Screenshot of the bulk pipeline migration panel and button" %>

Click the migrate button to convert the steps of every in your organization into YAML. The new YAML steps version of your pipeline will be auto-saved during migration, and will replace the web-based steps. 

After migrating, please manually check each pipeline, ensuring that they have completed sucessfully.
