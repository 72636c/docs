# SSO with OneLogin

- Teams using OneLogin can use it to log into Buildkite

## Setting up SSO
- sso setup ocurrs on both sides, in the OneLogin and buildkite organisations
- an organisation admin sets up OneLogin with the buildkite app
- the buildkite team enables sso for your organisation, with the details you provide

### Setup on the OneLogin website

1. search for Buildkite
1. add the Buildkite app to your OneLogin account


1. email support@buildkite with your SSO information:
- your domain name
- your Buildkite organisation slug
- SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)
	- click on the SSO tab of the app
	- copy the URL from the SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP) field
- x.509 certificate
	- on the same page, click the 'view details' button under the x.509 certificate
	- download the certificate and attach it to the email


### What the Buildkite team will do
1. enable sso for the specified organisation
1. get you to test that it's all working
1. force a logout for all the users in the organisation, so that everyone will log in via OneLogin next time they access Buildkite.com
