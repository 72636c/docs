# Migrating from Circle CI

Migrating continuous integration tools can be hard, so we've put together a guide to help you transition your Circle CI skills to Buildkite. This guide is explains about Buildkite Compat tool that helps with transform pipelines from other CI providers to Buildkite.

## Jobs to pipelines

CircleCI jobs can be mapped to pipelines in Buildkite. Let's look at an example CircleCI job and see how you can migrate it to a pipeline in Buildkite using Buildkite Compat tool.

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.6.2-stretch-browsers
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```
{: codeblock-file="basic.yml"}

Now you can convert above CirclCI job to a pipeline in Buildkite with Buildkite Compat tool using the following command:

```bash
buildkite-compat basic.yml
```

It generates the following pipeline file that can be used in Buildkite:

```yaml
steps:
- label: ":circleci: build"
  key: "build"
  commands:
    - "sudo cp -R /buildkite-checkout /home/circleci/checkout"
    - "sudo chown -R circleci:circleci /home/circleci/checkout"
    - "cd /home/circleci/checkout"
    - "pip install -r requirements/dev.txt"
  plugins:
  - docker#v3.3.0:
      image: "circleci/python:3.6.2-stretch-browsers"
      workdir: "/buildkite-checkout"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

Buildkite Compat tool can also be used via HTTP API, for example:

```bash
curl -X POST -F 'file=basic.yml' https://buildkite-compat.herokuapp.com
```
