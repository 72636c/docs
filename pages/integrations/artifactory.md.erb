# Artifactory

There are many ways to use [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/) with Buildkite. This document covers how to configure the Buildkite Agent’s built-in Artifactory support, as well as how to use Artifactory’s package management features in your Buildkite pipelines.

## Buildkite Agent’s Artifactory support

The Buildkite Agent can upload and download artifacts directly from Artifactory. Export the following environment variables in your [Agent environment hook](/docs/agent/v3/hooks) to configure the Agent’s Artifactory support.

See the [Managing Pipeline Secrets](/docs/pipelines/secrets) documentation for how to securely set up these environment variables.

_Required environment vars:_

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code>BUILDKITE_ARTIFACT_UPLOAD_DESTINATION</code></td>
    <td>
      The Artifactory repository and path that will be used to upload and download artifacts, starting with an rt:// prefix<br>
      <em>Example:</em> <code>"rt://some-repo/build-$BUILDKITE_BUILD_NUMBER/$BUILDKITE_JOB_ID/"</code><br>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>BUILDKITE_ARTIFACTORY_URL</code></td>
    <td>
      Your Artifactory instance URL, including the /artifactory postfix<br>
      <em>Example:</em> <code>https://my-artifactory-server/artifactory</code><br>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>BUILDKITE_ARTIFACTORY_USER</code></td>
    <td>
      The username of a user configured in your Artifactory instance<br>
      <em>Example:</em> <code>some-user</code><br>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>BUILDKITE_ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD</code></td>
    <td>
      The password for your Artifactory user<br>
      <em>Example:</em> <code>some-password</code><br>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

By default, any artifacts will be uploaded to the repository inside a folder named with the ID of the job that uploaded it. Specifying the `BUILDKITE_ARTIFACT_UPLOAD_DESTINATION` variable will overwrite this default. 

For example, the below Agent environment hook is stored securely on the Agent machine and exports all of the available variables:

```bash
export BUILDKITE_ARTIFACTORY_URL=http://my-domain:8081/artifactory
export BUILDKITE_ARTIFACTORY_USER=admin
export BUILDKITE_ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD=fishes-are-the-coolest
export BUILDKITE_ARTIFACT_UPLOAD_DESTINATION="rt://generic-repo/$BUILDKITE_JOB_ID/"
```

For best practices and recommendations about secret storage in the Agent, see the [Managing Secrets](/docs/pipelines/secrets) guide.

## Uploading and downloading artifacts

Once you've configured the Artifactory `buildkite-agent` environment variables, the `artifact_paths` attribute of command steps will automatically use the Artifactory configuration to upload artifacts. 

The following example `pipeline.yml` file will build a golang binary and upload it to Artifactory. The artifact will be visible in the build on Buildkite and can be downloaded in future steps using `buildkite-agent artifact download`.

```yml
steps:
  - label: "\:golang\: \:package\:"
    command: "go build -v -o myapp-darwin-amd64"
    artifact_paths: "myapp-darwin-amd64"
    plugins:
      - docker#v3.3.0:
          image: "golang:1.11"
```



You can also use [buildkite-agent artifact](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/cli-artifact) commands directly, for example `buildkite-agent artifact upload my-file` and `buildkite-agent artifact download my-file`.

All artifacts in Buildkite link to their location in Artifactory. Click through to view them in Artifactory.

## Configuring package management

In addition to managing your artifacts manually, you can also use [Artifactory's package management](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Package+Management) for installing and managing build dependencies.  

In the example Agent hook below, the registry URL is set to the URL of the npm repository in an Artifactory instance. All `npm` commands on this agent will then use the specified [Artifactory NPM registry](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/npm+Registry?src=sidebar).

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
export ARTIFACTORY_NPM_REGISTRY="http://my-artifactory-server.internal:8081/artifactory/api/npm/npm-local/"
npm config set registry "$ARTIFACTORY_NPM_REGISTRY"
```

If you're running npm commands in a Docker based build step, you'll need to pass the `ARTIFACTORY_NPM_REGISTRY` environment variable through to the container. The example `pipeline.yml` file below uses the [Docker plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/docker-buildkite-plugin) to pass the `ARTIFACTORY_NPM_REGISTRY` variable from the previous example through to the docker image used in the step:

```yml
steps:
  - label: "\:node\: \:hammer\:"
    commands:
      - npm install
      - npm test
    plugins:
      docker#v3.3.0:
        image: "node:11"
        environment:
          - NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY: "$ARTIFACTORY_NPM_REGISTRY"
```

You can follow a similar pattern for [Ruby gem repositories](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/RubyGems+Repositories), [Docker registries](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Docker+Registry), and any other Artifactory supported package managers.
