<%= toc %>

## Configuring the Buildkite Agent

- export the env vars in your agent env hook
- can also get them from a param store, they just need to be available to the agent at upload time

- required vars:
	- BUILDKITE_ARTIFACTORY_URL (your instance URL, when using the jfrog CLI, this would be expected to include the /artifactory postfix on URL)
	- BUILDKITE_ARTIFACTORY_USER (a user configured in your artifactory instance)
	- BUILDKITE_ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD

- optional vars:
	- BUILDKITE_ARTIFACT_UPLOAD_DESTINATION (fully qualified url of where you want to upload?)

## Uploading and downloading artifacts

- use the [artifact upload command](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/cli-artifact#uploading-artifacts)

(from the PR https://github.com/buildkite/agent/pull/924)
- The uploader will store artifacts in the repository under a folder matching the Job ID that uploaded it. for instance, README.md uploaded during job id abcdefgh-ijkl-mnop-qrst-uvwxyz123456 will be in repo/abcdefgh-ijkl-mnop-qrst-uvwxyz123456
- can specify upload destination if you want

- use the [artifact download command](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/cli-artifact#downloading-artifacts)
