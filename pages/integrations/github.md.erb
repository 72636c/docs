# GitHub

Buildkite can connect to your GitHub repository and use the Commit Status API to update the status of commits in Pull Requests.

To complete this integration, you will need admin privileges for your GitHub repository.

You'll be prompted to give permission for Buildkite to post status
updates, and then redirected back to your Connected Apps page.

## Setting up a new pipeline for a GitHub repository

1. Create a new pipeline on Buildkite, using your GitHub repository URL in the form `git@github.com:your/repo`.

    2. Paste in the the provided webhook URL.
    3. Select which events trigger the webhook.
