# GitHub

Buildkite can connect to your GitHub repository and use the Commit Status API to update the status of commits in Pull Requests.

To complete this integration, you will need admin privileges for your GitHub repository.

## Connecting Buildkite and GitHub

To connect your GitHub account open Buildkite’s Personal Settings, choose [Connected Apps](https://buildkite.com/user/connected-apps) then click the GitHub Connect button:

<%= image "personal-settings.png", width: 1467/2, height: 565/2, alt: "Screenshot of the Buildkite Connected Apps screen" %>

You'll be prompted to give permission for Buildkite to post status
updates, and then redirected back to your Connected Apps page.

## Setting up a new pipeline for a GitHub repository

1. Create a new pipeline on Buildkite, using your GitHub repository URL in the form `git@github.com:your/repo`.

    <%= image "new-pipeline.png", width: 1464/2, height: 744/2, alt: "Screenshot of adding a new pipeline " %>

2. Make sure to add at least one command to your pipeline, before clicking next.

3. Follow the instructions on the page to set up a webhook:

    1. Add a new webhook in Github.
    2. Paste in the the provided webhook URL.
    3. Select which events trigger the webhook.

## Branch configuration and Settings

You can edit the GitHub settings for each pipeline from the pipeline’s settings page:

If you need to set up the webhook again, you can find the instructions linked at the bottom of the pipeline GitHub settings page.

## Running builds on Pull Requests

To run builds for GitHub Pull Requests, edit the the GitHub settings for your Buildkite pipeline:

- Choose the 'build pull requests' checkbox.
- Optionally, limit Pull Request builds to certain branches.
- Optionally, skip Pull Request Builds for committs that have already been built.
- Optionally, build pull requests that are ready for review.
- Optionally, build pull requests for forked repositories. Make sure to take a look at the [managing pipeline secrets](/docs/pipelines/secrets) guide if you choose to do this.

If you want to run builds *only* on pull requests, set the Branch Filter Pattern in the pipeline to a branch name that will never occur (e.g. "this-branch-will-never-occur"). Pull request builds ignore the Branch Filter Pattern, and all pushes to other branches that don't match the pattern are ignored.

## Noreply email handling

When you [connect your GitHub account to Buildkite](#connecting-buildkite-and-github) the email address associated with the GitHub account is added to your Buildkite account. If you've got GitHub set not to display your email, `[username]@users.noreply.github.com` or the more recent `[username+id]@users.noreply.github.com` is added instead. The email address of a commit is one of the ways Buildkite matches webhook builds to users.
