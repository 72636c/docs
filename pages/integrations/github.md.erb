# GitHub

Buildkite can connect to your GitHub repository and use the [Commit Status API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#statuses) to update the status of commits in pull requests.

To complete this integration, you need admin privileges for your GitHub repository.

## Connecting Buildkite and GitHub

You can now use our [GitHub App](#to-connect-your-buildkite-account-to-github-using-the-github-app) to connect a Buildkite organization to a GitHub organization, removing the reliance on individual user connections to report build statuses. See the [changelog announcement](https://buildkite.com/changelog/102-github-app-integration).

If you want to [connect using OAuth](#to-connect-your-buildkite-account-to-github-using-oauth) you can still do so from your _Personal Settings_.

## Connect your Buildkite account to GitHub using the GitHub App

Connecting Buildkite and GitHub using the GitHub App lets your GitHub organization admins see permissions and manage access on a per-repository basis.

1. Open your Buildkite organization's _Settings_.
2. Select _[Repository Providers](https://buildkite.com/organizations/~/repository-providers)_ > _GitHub_.
    <%= image "repository-providers.png", width: 1168, height: 798, alt: "Screenshot of the Buildkite Repository Providers" %>
3. Select _Connect to a new GitHub Account_. If you have never connected your Buildkite and GitHub accounts before, you will first need to select _Connect_ and authorize Buildkite.
4. Select the GitHub organization you want to connect to your Buildkite organization. 
5. Choose which repositories Buildkite should have access to, then select _Install_. 

You can now [set up a pipeline](#setting-up-a-new-pipeline-for-a-github-repository).

## Connect your Buildkite account to GitHub using OAuth

To connect your GitHub account:

1. Open Buildkite’s _Personal Settings_.
2. Select _[Connected Apps](https://buildkite.com/user/connected-apps)_.
3. Select the GitHub _Connect_ button: 
    <%= image "personal-settings.png", width: 1650/2, height: 642/2, alt: "Screenshot of the Buildkite Connected Apps screen" %>
4. Select _Authorize buildkite_. GitHub redirects you back to your _Connected Apps_ page. 

You can now [set up a pipeline](#setting-up-a-new-pipeline-for-a-github-repository).

## Set up a new pipeline for a GitHub repository


1. Select _Pipelines_ > _New Pipeline_ <svg viewBox="0 0 22 22" width="22px" height="22px" style="fill: currentcolor; vertical-align: middle;"><title>New Pipeline</title><rect x="4" y="10" width="14" height="2"></rect>
<rect x="10" y="4" width="2" height="14"></rect>
</svg>
2. Enter your pipeline details, including your GitHub repository URL in the form `git@github.com:your/repo`.

    <%= image "new-pipeline.png", width: 1550/2, height: 846/2, alt: "Screenshot of adding a new pipeline " %>

3. If you are still using the web steps visual editor, add at least one step to your pipeline. Refer to [Defining Steps - Adding steps](docs/pipelines/defining_steps#adding-steps) for more information.
4. Select _Create Pipeline_.
4. Follow the onscreen instructions to set up a webhook:

    1. Add a new webhook in GitHub.
    2. Paste in the provided webhook URL.
    3. Select which events trigger the webhook.
5. If using the YAML steps editor, add at least one step to your pipeline, then select _Save and Build_. Refer to [Defining Steps - Adding steps](docs/pipelines/defining_steps#adding-steps) for more information.

If you need to set up the webhook again, you can find the instructions linked at the bottom of the pipeline GitHub settings page.

 You can edit your pipeline configuration at any time in _Pipeline Settings_.

## Branch configuration and settings

You can edit the GitHub settings for each pipeline from the pipeline’s settings page:

<%= image "github-settings.png", width: 1700/2, height: 2497/2, alt: "Screenshot of the Buildkite GitHub settings" %>

If you need more control over your Pipeline configuration, add a [Pipeline.yml](/docs/pipelines/defining-steps#adding-steps) to your repository. Then you can use [conditionals](/docs/pipelines/conditionals) and [branch filtering](/docs/pipelines/branch-configuration) to configure your Pipeline.

## Running builds on pull requests

To run builds for GitHub pull requests, edit the GitHub settings for your Buildkite pipeline and choose the 'Build Pull Requests' checkbox.

- Choose the 'build pull requests' checkbox.

Optionally, select one or more of the following:

- limit pull request builds to certain branches.
- skip pull request builds for commits that have already been built.
- build pull requests that are ready for review.
- build pull requests for forked repositories. Make sure to check the [managing secrets](/docs/pipelines/secrets) guide if you choose to do this.

<%= image "pull-requests.png", width: 1550/2, height: 1006/2, alt: "Screenshot of the Buildkite GitHub settings" %>

If you want to run builds *only* on pull requests, set the Branch Filter Pattern in the pipeline to a branch name that will never occur (e.g. "this-branch-will-never-occur"). Pull request builds ignore the Branch Filter Pattern, and all pushes to other branches that don't match the pattern are ignored.

## Noreply email handling

When you [connect your GitHub account to Buildkite](#connecting-buildkite-and-github) the email address associated with the GitHub account is added to your Buildkite account. If you've got GitHub set not to display your email, `[username]@users.noreply.github.com` or the more recent `[username+id]@users.noreply.github.com` is added instead. The email address of a commit is one of the ways Buildkite matches webhook builds to users.
