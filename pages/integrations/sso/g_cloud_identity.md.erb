# Single Sign-On with Google Cloud Identity

Google Cloud Identity can be used as an SSO provider for your Buildkite organization. To complete this tutorial, you will need admin privileges for both Google Cloud Identity and Buildkite.

### Step 1. Add Buildkite in Google Cloud Identity

<div class="Docs__note">
<p class="Docs__note__heading">Before starting your Cloud Identity setup</p>
<p>Email the Buildkite team at support@buildkite.com to request your unique SAML service URL, you will need this during setup.</p>
</div>

Log into your Google Admin Console, and follow these instructions:

1. In the 'Apps Settings' area of the console, select 'SAML Apps'.
1. Click the + button to open the Enable SSO for SAML Application modal.
1. Choose 'Setup my own custom app'.
1. Copy down the SSO URL and Entity ID, and download the Certificate. You'll need these in Step 2.
1. Give your application a name, for example 'Buildkite'.
1. Enter the following Service Provider Details:
    * ACS URL: the URL provided by Buildkite support
    * Entity ID: https://buildkite.com
1. Attribute mapping can be added after the initial setup and testing. Click 'Finish' to complete the setup.


### Step 2. Create an SSO Provider

In your Buildkite Organization Settings' Single Sign On menu item, choose the Custom SAML provider:

On the following screen in the setup form, choose the Manual data option and enter the IdP data you saved in Step 1: 

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)</td>
        <td>
            The SSO URL you copied down during the previous step.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Issuer URL</td>
        <td>
            The Entity ID that you copied down during the previous step. 
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>X.509 certificate</td>
        <td>
            The public key certificate generated for you by Google Cloud Identity that you downloaded during the previous step. You'll need the whole file, not just a link to the file. 
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<div class="Docs__note">
  <p>You can also set up SSO providers manually with GraphQL. See the <a href="/docs/integrations/sso/sso-setup-with-graphql">SSO Setup with GraphQL Guide</a> for detailed instructions and code samples.</p>
</div>

### Step 3. Perform a Test Login

Follow the instructions to perform a test login. Performing a test login will verify that SSO is working correctly before you activate it for your organization members.

### Step 4. Enable the new SSO Provider

Once you've performed a test login you can enable your provider. Activating SSO will not force a log out of existing users, but will cause all new or expired sessions to authorize through Cloud Identity before organization data can be accessed.

If you need to edit or update your Cloud Identity provider settings at any time, you will need to disable the provider first. For more information on disabling a provider, see the [disabling SSO](/docs/integrations/sso#disabling-and-removing-sso) section of the SSO overview.
