# Single Sign-On with Okta

Okta can be used as an SSO provider for your Buildkite organization. To complete this tutorial, you will need admin privileges for both Okta and Buildkite.

## Step 1. Add the Buildkite App to your Okta Account

Log into your Okta account, and follow these steps:

1. Click the Admin button in Okta to access your Admin dashboard
1. In the Shortcuts menu, click _Add Applications_ to search the Okta application directory
1. Search for 'Buildkite'
1. Click _Add_ to add the Buildkite app to your Okta account
1. Give your application a name in the _General Settings_ form
1. In the Buildkite application in Okta, select the tab labelled _Sign On_
1. In the Sign On section _Settings_, click the _Identity Provider Metadata_ link and copy the URL for use in the next step
1. In the Credential Details section, select 'Email' in the _Application username format_ dropdown
1. Select the tab labelled _Applications_ and assign your user account or group to the application for use in <a href="#step-3-perform-a-test-login">Step 3. Perform a Test Login</a>

## Step 2. Create an SSO Provider

In your Buildkite Organization Settings' _Single Sign On_ menu item, choose the Okta provider:

On the following screen in the _Metadata URL_ field, paste the Identity Provider Metadata link that you copied in the previous step.

<%= image "okta-settings.png", width: 1742/2, height: 606/2, alt: "Screenshot of the Buildkite Okta Settings Page" %>

<div class="Docs__note">
  <p>You can also set up SSO providers manually with GraphQL. See the <a href="/docs/integrations/sso/sso-setup-with-graphql">SSO Setup with GraphQL Guide</a> for detailed instructions and code samples.</p>
</div>

### SCIM Deprovisioning

<div class="Docs__note">
  <p>This integration with Okta is currently under development and is not available to customers yet.</p>
</div>

Using the SCIM provisioning settings in Okta you can automatically remove user accounts from your Buildkite organization. In Okta this feature is called 'Deactivating' a user, and it is the only SCIM operation Buildkite currently supports.

After creating your SSO Provider in Buildkite, copy the _API token_ and _SCIM URL_ from your Okta SSO Provider Settings:

<%= image "okta-scim-settings.png", width: 1440/2, height: 548/2, alt: "Screenshot of the Buildkite Okta Settings SCIM Deprovisioning section" %>

Return to your Buildkite application in Okta to set up deprovisioning:

1. On the _Provisioning_ tab in the Okta Buildkite application, select _To App_ from the left side menu
1. Edit the _Provisioning to App_ settings, and enable _Create Users_ and _Deactivate Users_
1. Select _Integrations_ from the left side menu
1. Enter the token and URL that you copied from your Buildkite SSO Provider
1. Save and test your settings

Return to Buildkite and your SSO Provider Settings before continuing to the next step.

## Step 3. Perform a Test Login

Follow the instructions to perform a test login. Performing a test login will verify that SSO is working correctly before you activate it for your organization members.

## Step 4. Enable the new SSO Provider

Once you've performed a test login you can enable your provider. Activating SSO will not force a log out of existing users, but will cause all new or expired sessions to authorize through Okta before organization data can be accessed.

If you need to edit or update your Okta provider settings at any time, you will need to disable the provider first. For more information on disabling a provider, see the [disabling SSO](/docs/integrations/sso#disabling-and-removing-sso) section of the SSO overview.
