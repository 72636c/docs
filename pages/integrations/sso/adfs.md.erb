# Single Sign-On with ADFS

Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) can be used as an SSO provider for your Buildkite organization. To complete this tutorial, you will need admin privileges for both your ADFS server and Buildkite.

### Step 1. Set up Buildkite in the ADFS management console

<div class="Docs__note">
<p class="Docs__note__heading">Before starting your ADFS setup</p>
<p>Email the Buildkite team at support@buildkite.com to request your unique SAML service URL, you will need this when creating your ADFS relying party trust.</p>
</div>

The instructions below will guide you through using a series of wizards to:

* Add a 'Relying Party Trust'
* Add an 'Issuance Transform Rule', a type of 'Claim Rule'
* Export the Token-signing Certificate
* Update the Authentication Policy

With these wizards, you'll set up your domain for SSO and retreive the information the Buildkite team requires to complete the setup process.

<p class="Docs__note__heading">This guide was written for, and tested using, Windows Server 2016</p>
<p>Some of the wizard pages and dialog tab names have changed across versions of Windows Server.</p>

<p>For a guide written for Windows Server 2012, the <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/docs/guides/adfs-sso-guide/">Pagerduty SSO integration guide</a> is very similar to Buildkite. Follow the Pagerduty instructions, and subsitute in the Buildkite values from the instructions below.</p>

<div class="Docs__note">
  <p>You can also set up SSO providers manually with GraphQL. See the <a href="/docs/integrations/sso/sso-setup-with-graphql">SSO Setup with GraphQL Guide</a> for detailed instructions and code samples.</p>
</div>

#### **Step 1.1 Add a Relying Party Trust**

From the `Actions` sidebar, click `Add relying party trust...` to start the wizard

1. <u>Welcome</u>: select `Claims aware`
1. <u>Select data source</u>: select `Enter data about the relying party manually`
1. <u>Specify display name</u>: call your relying party `Buildkite`
1. <u>Choose profile</u>: select `ADFS profile`
1. <u>Configure certificate</u>: skip this step, as you don't need a token encryption certificate
1. <u>Configure URL</u>: 
	select `Enable support for the SAML 2.0 WebSSO protocol` 
	enter the unique SAML service URL you received from Buildkite as your `Relying party SAML 2.0 SSO service URL`
1. <u>Configure identifiers</u>: 
	enter `https://<your IDP url>/adfs/services/trust` into the `Relying party trust identifier` field
	click `add` to add it to the `Relying party trust identifiers` list
1. <u>Choose Access Control Policy</u>:
	choose `Permit everyone`
	you can choose to select specific users, but that will involve further steps that aren't covered by this guide
1. <u>Ready to add trust</u>: review your settings to make sure all the urls are correct
1. <u>Finish</u>:
	leave the `configure claims issuance policy for this application` box checked
	click `close` to close the wizard and save your setup

In the `Actions` sidebar, you should now have a subheading `Buildkite`. 

#### **Step 1.2 Add an issuance transform rule**

From the `Buildkite` section of the `Actions` sidebar, click `Edit claim issuance policy...`

Here we're going to add three rules. Add each rule using the `Add Rule` button on the Issuance transform rules tab:

Rule 1

1. <u>Choose rule type</u>: `Send LDAP Attributes as claims`
1. <u>Configure claim rule</u>:
	- <u>Claim Rule Name</u>: Get Attributes
	- <u>Attribute Store</u>: Active Directory
	- <u>Mapping of LDAP Attributes to outgoing claim types</u>:
		+ <u>LDAP Attribute</u>: Email Addresses, Outgoing claim type: Email address
		+ <u>LDAP Attribute</u>: Display-Name, Outgoing claim type: Name
1. Click `Finish` to add the rule

Rule 2

1. <u>Choose rule type</u>: `Transform an incoming claim`
1. <u>Configure claim rule</u>:
	- <u>Claim Rule Name</u>: Name ID Transform
	- <u>Incoming Claim Type</u>: Email address
	- <u>Outgoing Claim Type</u>: Name ID
	- <u>Outgoing Name ID Format</u>: Email
	- Select `Pass through all claim values`
1. Click `Finish` to add the rule

Rule 3

<ol>
	<li><u>Choose rule type</u>: `Send claims using a custom rule`</li>
	<li><u>Configure claim rule</u>:
	<ul>
		<li><u>Claim Rule Name</u>: 'Name' Attribute Name Transform</li>
		<li><u>Custom Rule</u>: 
<pre><code>c:[Type == "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name"]
 => issue(Type = "Name", Issuer = c.Issuer, OriginalIssuer = c.OriginalIssuer, Value = c.Value, ValueType = c.ValueType);</code></pre>
</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Click `Finish` to add the rule</li>
	<li>Click `OK` to save and exit the Claim Issuance Policy dialog</li>
</ol>

For more information on what other attributes Buildkite accepts, see the [SAML User Attributes](/docs/integrations/sso/custom-saml#saml-user-attributes) table in the Custom SAML Guide.

#### **Step 1.3 Export the token signing certificate**

From the `Service` section of the `ADFS` console tree, select the `Certificates` subsection

1.  Click on the certificate listed under the heading `Token-signing`
2.  In the `CN=ADFS Signing` section of the `Actions` sidebar, click `View Certificate...`
3.  In the `Certificate` dialog, select the `Details` tab
4.  Click the `Copy to File...` button
5.  Start the `Certificate Export Wizard`
6.  Export File Format: select `Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER)`
7.  File to Export: name your file, and choose where you'd like to export the file
8.  Completing the Certificate Export Wizard: check the settings are correct, and click `Finish`
9.  Exit the `Certificate` dialog

#### **Step 1.4 Update the authentication policy**

From the `Service` section of the `ADFS` console tree, select the `Authentication Methods` subsection

1. Under the `Primary Authentication Methods` header, click the `Edit` link
2. In the `Intranet` section, ensure that the `Forms Authentication` box is checked 
3. Click `OK` to exit the dialog

### Step 2. Create an SSO Provider

In your Buildkite Organization Settings' Single Sign On menu item, choose the ADFS provider:

<%= image "sso-settings.png", width: 1458/2, height: 926/2, alt: "Screenshot of the Buildkite SSO Settings Page" %>

On the following screen in the setup form, enter your IdP information:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Login URL</td>
        <td>
          The URL where you can log in to your ADFS service. Usually your domain name or IP, with <code>/adfs/ls</code> appended.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Federation Service Identifier</td>
        <td>
            The URL that identifies your ADFS service. Usually your domain name or IP, with <code>/adfs/services/trust</code> appended.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>X.509 certificate</td>
        <td>
       	  Attach the X.509 certificate that you downloaded during setup
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Step 3. Perform a Test Login

Follow the instructions to perform a test login. Performing a test login will verify that SSO is working correctly before you activate it for your organization members.

### Step 4. Enable the new SSO Provider

Once you've performed a test login you can enable your provider. Activating SSO will not force a log out of existing users, but will cause all new or expired sessions to authorize through ADFS before organization data can be accessed.

If you need to edit or update your ADFS provider settings at any time, you will need to disable the provider first. For more information on disabling a provider, see the [disabling SSO](/docs/integrations/sso#disabling-and-removing-sso) section of the SSO overview.
