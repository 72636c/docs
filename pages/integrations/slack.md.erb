# Slack

The [Slack](https://slack.com/) notification service in Buildkite lets you receive notifications about your builds in your Slack workspace.

## Configuring

From your [Organizationâ€™s Notification Settings](https://buildkite.com/organizations/-/services), add a Slack notification service:

You can then click the "Add to Slack" button:

This will take you to Slack, where you can log in, choose a workspace, and grant Buildkite the ability to post in a particular channel:

It shows that Buildkite needs to know some info about you and your workspace, and for you to choose a channel for Buildkite to post in." %>

Once you have granted access to your Slack workspace, you can then give it a description, and choose how the notifications should display, and which notifications you're interested in:

## Changing channels

Once created, the Slack channel and workspace cannot be changed. To post to a different channel or workspace, create a new notification service.

## Upgrading a legacy Slack service

Slack will stop accepting notifications from legacy Buildkite services soon. You will need to have upgraded these services to continue receiving notifications.

### Identify where your existing services post notifications

TK: click the notification service in Buildkite, look at the webhook URL, then go manually find the buildkite integration on Slack which has that webhook URL

### Confirm which pipelines, and which events, are posted

TK: once you've found the matching Buildkite service and Slack app, confirm the Slack 

### Create a new Slack notification service which posts

TK: replicate that same thing in a new one... :(
