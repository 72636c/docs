# Slack

The [Slack](https://slack.com/) notification service in Buildkite lets you receive notifications about your builds in your Slack workspace.

## Adding a notification service

In your [Organizationâ€™s Notification Settings](https://buildkite.com/organizations/-/services), add a Slack notification service:

Click the "Add to Slack" button:

This will take you to Slack. Log in, choose a workspace, and grant Buildkite the ability to post in your chosen channel:

It shows that Buildkite needs to know some information about you and your workspace, and asks you to choose a channel for Buildkite to post in." %>

Once you have granted access to your Slack workspace, give it a description, choose how the notifications should display, and select the type of notifications you want to receive:

## Changing channels

Once created, the Slack channel and workspace cannot be changed. To post to a different channel or workspace, create a new notification service.

## Upgrading a legacy Slack service

Slack will stop accepting notifications from legacy Buildkite services soon. You will need to have upgraded these services to continue receiving notifications.

### Identify where your existing services post notifications

TK: click the notification service in Buildkite, look at the webhook URL, then go manually find the buildkite integration on Slack which has that webhook URL

### Confirm which pipelines, and which events, are posted

TK: once you've found the matching Buildkite service and Slack app, confirm the Slack 

### Create a new Slack notification service which posts

TK: replicate that same thing in a new one... :(
