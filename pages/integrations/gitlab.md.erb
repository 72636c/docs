# GitLab

You can use Buildkite to run builds on [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) commits.

## GitLab repositories

If you host your repositories on [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/) enter your gitlab.com repository URL when you create your pipeline in Buildkite (for example, `git@gitlab.com:your/repo.git`) and follow the instructions provided on that page to set up webhooks.

## GitLab Community/Enterprise Edition

<section class="Docs__note">
  <p>The earliest supported version of GitLab is <a href=https://about.gitlab.com/2014/10/22/gitlab-7-4-released/>7.4</a>.</p>

1. Open your Buildkite _Organization Settings_ and choose [Repository Providers](https://buildkite.com/organizations/-/repository-providers)
2. Select _GitLab_.
3. Select the GitLab Edition Type (Community or Enterprise) you want to connect to your Buildkite Organization.
4. Enter the URL to your GitLab installation (for example, `https://git.example.org`).
5. You can optionally specify a list of IP addresses to restrict where builds can be triggered from. This field accepts a space separated list of networks in [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing).

6. Select _Save GitLab Settings_ before leaving this page.
7. Create a new pipeline on Buildkite using your GitLab repository's URL (for example, `git@git.mycompany.com:your/repo.git`) and follow the instructions on the pipeline creation page.

## Branch configuration and settings

You can edit the GitLab settings for each pipeline from the pipelineâ€™s settings page. Go to _Pipelines_ > _Pipeline Menu_ > _Pipeline Settings_ > _GitLab_ | _GitLab Enterprise_.

If you need more control over your pipeline configuration, add a [pipeline.yml](/docs/pipelines/defining-steps#adding-steps) to your repository. Then you can use [conditionals](/docs/pipelines/conditionals) and [branch filtering](/docs/pipelines/branch-configuration) to configure your pipeline.

## Using one repository in multiple pipelines and organizations

If you want to use the same repository in multiple pipelines (including pipelines in different Buildkite organizations), you need to configure a separate webhook for each pipeline. Follow the _GitLab Webhook Setup_ instructions in the Buildkite UI. Buildkite shows you these instructions when you create the pipeline, but you can also find them in _Pipeline Settings_ > _GitLab_ > _GitLab Setup Instructions_.
