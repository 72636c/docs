# GitLab

You can use Buildkite to run builds on [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) commits.

## gitlab.com repositories

If you are hosting your repositories on [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/) enter your gitlab.com repository URL when you create your pipeline in Buildkite (e.g. `git@gitlab.com:your/repo.git`) and follow the instructions provided on that page to set up webhooks.

The webhook setup instructions are also available from the GitLab section of the Pipeline Settings. 

## Self-hosted GitLab repositories

On the Organization Settings page, find the **GitLab (Self Hosted)** section. Select your GitLab edition (Community or Enterprise), and enter the URL to your GitLab installation (e.g. `https://git.mycompany.com`).

You can optionally specify a list of IP addresses to restrict where builds can be triggered from. This field accepts a space separated list of networks in [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing).
