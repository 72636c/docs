## Step 1: connect a repository provider and set up a pipeline

1. In your *Settings*, navigate to *Repository Providers*.
2. Select *Bitbucket Server*.
3. In *URLs*, enter the address of your Bitbucket Server, including a port if needed. For example, if you have it installed locally and running on `localhost:8000`, enter `localhost:8000`. You also have the option to add *Allowed IP Addresses* in *Network Settings*.
4. Select *Save Settings*.
5. Set up a pipeline as normal. Refer to [Pipelines](/docs/pipelines) for more information.

## Step 2: confirm your setup

If your configuration worked, Buildkite automatically recognizes your repository URL as a Bitbucket Server repository. To check this, go to *Pipelines* > *`your-pipeline`* > *Pipeline Settings*. You should see *Bitbucket Server* in the *Pipeline Settings* menu.

## Step 3: work through the in-app guide to set up your webhook

Buildkite includes built-in instructions on how to set up a Bitbucket Server webhook.

1. Navigate to *Pipelines* > *`your-pipeline`* > *Pipeline Settings* > *Bitbucket Server*. 
2. Select *Bitbucket Server Setup Instructions*.
3. Follow the on screen instructions to configure your webhook.
