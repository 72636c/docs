| Non-breaking characters  | Non-breaking spaces are intended for use when the separation of two adjacent words through line wrapping will result in a loss of meaning or legibility. For example, some authors prefer values and their units, such as "12 kg", to be treated as a single word. Likewise, soft hyphens are intended for use when there is a preferred point for the breaking of a word during line wrapping. https://www.oxygenxml.com/dita/styleguide/webhelp-feedback/Artefact/Syntax_and_Markup/c_Non_Breaking_Spaces.html | Generally not used.
