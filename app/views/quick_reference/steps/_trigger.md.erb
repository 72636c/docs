A *trigger* step creates a build on another pipeline. You can use trigger steps to separate your test and deploy pipelines, or to create build dependencies between pipelines. 

### Permissions

All builds created by a trigger step will have the same author as the parent build. This user must:

- be a member of your organization
- have a verified email address

If you have Teams enabled in your organization, the authoring user must also have:

- 'Build' permission on every pipeline that will be triggered

If the author does not have the required access, the build will fail, and builds on subsequent pipelines will not be triggered.
