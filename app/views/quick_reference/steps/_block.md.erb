A block step is used to pause the execution of a build and wait on a team member to unblock it via the web or the API.

A block step is functionally identical to an input step, however a block step creates implicit dependencies to the steps before and after it. Note that explicit dependencies specified by depends_on take precedence over implicit dependencies, steps will run when the step they depend on complete, without waiting for block or wait steps unless those are also explicit dependencies.

You can add form fields to block steps with the `fields` attribute. There are two field types available: *text* or *select*. The select input type is displayed as radio buttons when it contains less than six items, and as a drop down list when it contains more than six items.

The data you collect from these fields is then available to subsequent steps in the pipeline in the [build meta-data](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/build-meta-data).
