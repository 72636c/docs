An optional map of attributes for the triggered build. Attributes include:

- `message` - The message for the build. Supports emoji. Default: the label of the trigger step.
- `commit` - The commit hash for the build. Default: `"HEAD"`
- `branch` - The branch for the build. Default: The triggered pipeline's default branch.
- `meta_data` - A map of [meta-data](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/build-meta-data) for the build.
- `env` - A map of [environment variables](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/environment-variables) for the build.

```yaml
- trigger: "data-generator"
  label: ":package: Generate data"
  build:
    meta_data:
      release-version: "1.1"
```

You can use [environment variable substitution](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/cli-pipeline#environment-variable-substitution) to set attribute values:

```yaml
- trigger: "app-deploy"
  label: ":rocket: Deploy"
  branches: "master"
  async: true
  build:
    message: "${BUILDKITE_MESSAGE}"
    commit: "${BUILDKITE_COMMIT}"
    branch: "${BUILDKITE_BRANCH}"
```

To pass through pull request information to the triggered build, pass through the branch and pull request environment variables:

```yaml
- trigger: "app-sub-pipeline"
  label: "Sub-pipeline"
  build:
    message: "${BUILDKITE_MESSAGE}"
    commit: "${BUILDKITE_COMMIT}"
    branch: "${BUILDKITE_BRANCH}"
    env:
      BUILDKITE_PULL_REQUEST: "${BUILDKITE_PULL_REQUEST}"
      BUILDKITE_PULL_REQUEST_BASE_BRANCH: "${BUILDKITE_PULL_REQUEST_BASE_BRANCH}"
      BUILDKITE_PULL_REQUEST_REPO: "${BUILDKITE_PULL_REQUEST_REPO}"
```

To set environment variables on the build created by the trigger step, use the `env` attribute:

```yaml
- trigger: "release-binaries"
  label: ":package: Release"
  build:
    env:
      RELEASE_STREAM: "${RELEASE_STREAM:-stable}"
```
