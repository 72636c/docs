A list of input fields required to be filled out before unblocking the step.  Available input field types: `text`, `select`

## Text Input Attributes

For a text input field, the required attributes are `text`, for the input's label, and a machine-readable `key`.

```yaml
- block: "Request Release"
  fields:
    - text: "Code Name"
      key: "release-name"
```

Optional attributes are: 

- `hint` - The explanatory text shown after the label.
- `required` - A boolean value that defines whether the field is required for form submission.
- `default` - The value that is pre-filled in the text field.

```yaml
- block: "Request Release"
  fields:
    - text: "Code Name"
      key: "release-name"
      hint: "Whatâ€™s the code name for this release? :name_badge:"
      required: false
      default: "Release #"
```

## Select Input Attributes

For a select input field, the required attributes are `text`, for the input's label, and a set of `options`, each of which must have a `label` and a `value`.

```yaml
- block: "Request Release"
    fields:
      - select: "Stream"
        key: "release-stream"
        options:
          - label: "Beta"
            value: "beta"
          - label: "Stable"
            value: "stable"
```

Optional attributes are: 

- `hint` - The explanatory text shown after the label.
- `required` - A boolean value that defines whether the field is required for form submission.
- `multiple` - A boolean value that defines whether multiple options may be selected. When multiple options are selected, they are delimited in the meta-data field by a line break (`\\n`).
- `default` - The value of the option or options that will be pre-selected. When `multiple` is enabled, this can be an array of values to select by default.

```yaml
- block: "Request Release"
  fields:
    - select: "Stream"
      key: "release-stream"
      hint: "Which release stream does this belong in? :fork:"
      required: false
      default: "beta"
      options:
        - label: "Beta"
          value: "beta"
        - label: "Stable"
          value: "stable"
```
