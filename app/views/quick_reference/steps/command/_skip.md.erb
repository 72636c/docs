Whether to skip this step or not. Passing a string provides a reason for skipping this command. Passing an empty string is equivalent to `false`. Note: Skipped steps will be hidden in the pipeline view by default, but can be made visible by toggling the 'Skipped jobs' icon.

```yaml
skip: false
```

```yaml
skip: true
```

```yaml
skip: "Reason for skipping"
```
