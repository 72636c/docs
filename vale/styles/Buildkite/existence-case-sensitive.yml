# This style suggests alternatives where the case on the right side of the swap is strict.

# Use this style to suggest alternatives where the case on the right side is always required.
# For example, use this style to always require "Amazon Web Services" and never "Amazon web services".

# For most single words, try using the Buildkite.spelling ignore list first.

# On the left side of the swap, use the case-insensitive modifier group `(?i:)` to capture any case.
# Or use a regular string to capture a specific, frequent case error (e.g., Bell Hooks â†’ bell hooks).
